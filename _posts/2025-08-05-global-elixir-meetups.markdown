> Update: Our first Global Elixir Meetups was a success with 46 meetups spread across six continents. Thanks to everyone who organized and attended. See you next time!

We are launching [Global Elixir Meetups (GEMs)](https://globalelixirmeetups.com) - a week where the Elixir community organizes meetups around the world to meet and learn from each other. Our goal is to spark local communities, old and new, to get together and discuss everything related to Elixir and the Erlang VM.

Our first GEM will happen on 22-28 September and, if you were looking for an opportunity to organize a meetup, now is the perfect time: visit [the Global Elixir Meetups website](https://globalelixirmeetups.com) to learn how to organize and attend. Organizers may also opt-in to live stream their meetups to the whole world directly from the website.

The Global Elixir Meetup is organized by [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com), who brought their expertise as creators of [Membrane](https://membrane.stream) and [Elixir WebRTC](https://elixir-webrtc.org) to make it all possible. At launch, we are already counting with 7 meetups across Europe, South America, and North America, with hopefully more continents joining us soon.

Go ahead and find your closest GEM or run your own!
