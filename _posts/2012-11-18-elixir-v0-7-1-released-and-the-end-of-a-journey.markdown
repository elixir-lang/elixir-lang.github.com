Elixir v0.7.1 was released this weekend to celebrate the end of a two months journey traveling around Europe and United States talking about and exposing Elixir to new developers.

This is a minor release that contains a couple enhancements regarding UTF-8, [dialyzer](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/dialyzer.html) support and bug fixes.

During this time traveling around, we have spoken at many conferences, as [Strange Loop](http://thestrangeloop.com/), [Øredev](http://oredev.org/) and [Rupy](http://rupy.eu/) as well as at different companies. Developers from different backgrounds have shown interest in Elixir, [written about it](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2012/10/31/elixir-erlang-and-the-dining-philosophers/), joined us at #elixir-lang on freenode and contributed to the language. As of today, Elixir is powered by 51 different contributors!

In case you missed any of those conferences, [the talk I presented at Øredev is available and you can watch it now](http://vimeo.com/53221562). The slides are also available below.

If you want to hear more about Elixir at a conference or an event, please let us know. Thank you and don't forget to [give Elixir a try](/getting_started/1.html)!
