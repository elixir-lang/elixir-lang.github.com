excerpt: Elixir v0.9.0 is released with support for reducers, umbrella projects, faster compilation times and drops support for R15 and before.
---

While [Programming Elixir](http://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir) was being announced, we have been working on Elixir v0.9.0 which is finally out. This release contains new features, important performance optimizations and bug fixes.

Elixir v0.9.0 also removes support to Erlang R15 and before. In case you still need to run Elixir software on R15, we have also released Elixir v0.8.3, which contains many of the enhancements in v0.9.0. Check the [CHANGELOG for more details for both releases](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/v0.9.0/CHANGELOG.md).

All this work was achieved by a very vibrant community! Over the last month, 17 authors have pushed more than 500 commits, where more than 60 pull requests were merged and more than 80 issues were closed.

Let's talk about the goodies!

## Compilation time improvements

We have spent some time improving compilation time. The particular scenario we have worked on was the definition of records:

{% highlight elixir %}
defrecord User, name: nil, age: nil
{% endhighlight %}

Records are a good scenario because they are implemented in Elixir, using Elixir macros, and they also define a module underneath, which exercises the Erlang VM compilation stack.

We have used [fprof](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/fprof.html) to identify the bottlenecks and made the compilation stack 35% faster. We have also identified bottlenecks coming from Erlang and [pushed some patches](https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/32b194495f353dde014b00008a630eeff2a71056) that should benefit both Elixir and Erlang code.

## Umbrella projects

In Elixir, an application denotes a component implementing some specific functionality, that can be started and stopped as a unit, and which can be re-used in other systems as well.

As a project grows, it is recommended to break it apart into smaller, isolated applications and bundle them together. The issue so far was that Elixir did not provide good support for working with many applications at once, and compiling and managing those applications became rather a tedious work.

Elixir v0.9.0 now supports umbrella projects which can work with many applications at the same time. You can create a new umbrella project with:

    $ mix new my_project --umbrella

The generated project will have the following structure:

    apps/
    mix.exs
    README.md

Now, inside the `apps` directory, you can create as many applications as you want and by running `mix compile`, inside the umbrella project will automatically compile all applications. The [original discussion for this feature](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/issues/667) contains more details about how it all works.

## Reducers

Elixir v0.9.0 changes its main abstraction for enumeration from iterators to reducers. Before Elixir v0.9.0, when you invoked:

{% highlight elixir %}
Enum.map([1,2,3], fn(x) -> x * x end)
#=> [1, 4, 9]
{% endhighlight %}

It asked the `Enum.Iterator` protocol for instruction on how to iterate the list `[1,2,3]`. This iteration happened by retrieving each item in the list, one by one, until there were no items left.

This approach posed many problems:

* Iterators are very hard to compose;
* Iterators contain state. You need to know, at each moment, what is the next element you have to iterate next. We use functions to pass the iteration state around;
* Iterators have the "dangling open resource" problem. Consider that you want to iterate a file with `Enum.map/2` as above. If any step during the iteration fails, there is no easy way to notify the iterator (in this case, th opened file) that iteration failed, so we can't close the file automatically, leaving it to the user.

Reducers solve all of those problems by using a more functional approach. Instead of asking a list how to iterate itself, we generate a recipe and pass this recipe to the list reduce on itself.

Here is how we implement the `Enumerable` protocol for lists:

{% highlight elixir %}
defimpl Enumerable, for: List do
  def reduce(list, acc, fun) do
    do_reduce(list, acc, fun)
  end

  defp do_reduce([h|t], acc, fun) do
    do_reduce(t, fun.(h, acc), fun)
  end

  defp do_reduce([], acc, fun) do
    acc
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

The implementation above works as a simple `reduce` (also called `fold`, `inject` or `foldl` in other languages). Here is how it works:

{% highlight elixir %}
Enumerable.reduce([1,2,3], 0, fn(x, acc) -> x + acc end)
#=> 6
{% endhighlight %}

Now the `Enum.map/2` we have seen above is implemented in terms of this reducing function:

{% highlight elixir %}
defmodule Enum do
  def map(collection, fun) do
    Enumerable.reduce(collection, [], fn(x, acc) ->
      [fun.(x, acc)|acc]
    end) |> reverse
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

This approach solves all the problems above:

* Reducers are composable (notice how we have implemented map on top of reduce by composing functions);
* Reducers are self-contained: there is no need keep state around which also solves the "dangling open resource" problem. The data type now knows exactly when the iteration starts and when it finishes;
* Reducers do not dictate how a type should be enumerated. This means types like `Range` and `HashDict` can provide a much faster implementation for Reducers.

Reducers also opens up room for lazy and parallel enumeration of functions, as [the Clojure community has already proven](http://clojure.com/blog/2012/05/08/reducers-a-library-and-model-for-collection-processing.html).

## Other bits

We have also many other smaller improvements:

* Our CLI now supports `--hidden` and `--cookie` flags which are useful for distributed modes;
* Our test framework, ExUnit, is now able to capture all the communication that happens with a registed IO device, like `:stdio` and `:stderr`, via [`ExUnit.CaptureIO`](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/master/ExUnit.CaptureIO.html). This is very useful for testing how your software reacts on some inputs and what it prints to the terminal;
* `String`, `Enum` and `Dict` modules got more convenience functions to work with their respective types;
* `IEx` now allows files to be imported into the shell with `import_file` and also loads `~/.iex` on startup for custom configuration;
* And many, many more!

We are very thankful for the community around us, which sent bug reports, provided bug fixes and contributed all those amazing features. And when are **you** joining us?
