[Dashbit](https://dashbit.co), [Oban](https://oban.pro), and the [Erlang Ecosystem Foundation (EEF)](https://erlef.org) are glad to announce a new program, which we will trial over the next 12 months, called "Elixir Outreach". Our goal is to provide funds to community members who want to present Elixir and Erlang to other ecosystems and communities, while respecting our joint values.

In a nutshell:

* We will provide funds to community members to speak **in-person** about anything related to Elixir and the Erlang VM.

* We will cover hotel and transportation costs for up to $700 USD. Please reach out, even if you expect to exceed that limit. This is our first time running the program and we're refining the budget.

* The event must expect at least 150 attendees and happen outside of the Elixir, overall BEAM, and functional programming communities. In other words, we won't cover costs for attending Erlang, Elixir, or other BEAM/FP conferences nor meetups. Consider it as an opportunity to learn and bring external knowledge and experiences to the BEAM community.

* You will be expected to send a report about your experience. The format and duration is up to you. We'd prefer that you write a blog post or an article sharing your overall experience with the involved communities. However, if you would prefer to only send it privately to us, that's fine too!

The event should take place within your area. Our overall goal is to support multiple individuals, rather than drain our budget on a few long-distance flights (such as across coasts or continents). We are flexible on event location, distance, or type. If in doubt, reach out to [elixir_outreach at erlef dot org](mailto:elixir_outreach@erlef.org)

Our initial budget of $7000 was donated by Dashbit ($5000) and Oban ($2000) to the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation (EEF), specifically for this program. The EEF will oversee the distribution of the funds.

## Requesting a stipend

To request a stipend, visit the [Erlang Ecosystem Foundation website and choose "Elixir Outreach" as the stipend type](https://erlef.org/stipends/form?type=elixir-outreach).

Given we have limited funds, we cannot guarantee they will be available when you request them. We recommend reaching out to us before submitting or accepting your talk. Therefore, by contacting us early, we can validate if the event matches the criteria above, ask questions, and earmark the funds. Once your talk is accepted, send us any itemized travel and accommodation costs so we can transfer the stipend to you, (not in excess of $700 USD).

You can also request a stipend after your talk has already been accepted, but then there are no guarantees a stipend will be available.

Our goal is to make this process simple and as straight-forward as possible. Although, we reserve the right to refuse a request for any reason. If in doubt, reach out to [elixir_outreach at erlef dot org](mailto:elixir_outreach@erlef.org).

## Acknowledgements

This is a new effort for all involved! Please be patient while we figure out the details.

If you are looking for conferences to speak at, [Dave Aronson keeps a list of CFPs closing soon](https://www.codosaur.us/speaking/cfps-ending-soon) and there are likely others available. Note, we don’t necessarily endorse all of the conferences listed nor guarantee they meet the requirements above, but the list may help you get the ball rolling.

Thanks to Parker Selbert, Shannon Selbert, Brian Cardarella, Alistair Woodman, and Lee Barney for feedback and helping make this a reality.
