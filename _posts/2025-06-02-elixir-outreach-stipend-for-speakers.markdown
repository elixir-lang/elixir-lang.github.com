[Dashbit](https://dashbit.co), [Oban](https://oban.pro), and the [Erlang Ecosystem Foundation (EEF)](https://erlef.org) are glad to announce a new program, which we will trial over the next 12 months, called "Elixir Outreach". Our goal is to provide funds to community members who want to present Elixir and Erlang to other ecosystems and communities, while respecting their values and ours.

In a nutshell:

* We will provide funds to community members to speak **in-person** about anything related to Elixir and the Erlang VM.

* We will cover hotel and transportation costs up to $700 USD. Given this is our first time running this program, we are unsure if this budget is enough. So please reach out to us, even if you need to go over the limit.

* The event must expect at least 150 attendees and happen outside of the Elixir, overall BEAM, and functional programming communities. In other words, we won't cover costs for attending Erlang, Elixir, or other BEAM/FP conferences nor meetups. You should also consider it as an opportunity to learn and bring external knowledge and experiences to the BEAM community.

* You will be expected to send a report about your experience. How short or long the report will be is up to you. The best would be to write a blog post or an article, sharing your experiences as a whole with the involved communities, but if you would prefer to only send it privately to us, that is fine too!

The event must happen within your area. We won't place limits on distance or event types, simply keep in mind our overall goal is to support multiple individuals, rather than spend all fund on a few long-distance flights (such as across coasts or across continents). If in doubt, reach out to [elixir_outreach at erlef dot org](mailto:elixir_outreach@erlef.org)

Our initial budget is of $7000, donated by Dashbit ($5000) and Oban ($2000), specifically for this program to the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation, which will oversee the distribution of the funds.

## Requesting a stipend

You can request a stipend [in the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation website and choose the “Elixir Outreach” as the stipend type](https://erlef.org/stipends/form?type=elixir-outreach).

We recommend reaching out to us before submitting or accepting your talk. Given we have limited funds, we cannot guarantee they will be available by the time you request them. Therefore, by contacting us early, we can validate if the event matches the criteria above, ask questions, and earmark the funds. Once your talk is accepted, you send us the flight and accommodation costs, and we will transfer the stipend to you, not to exceed $700 USD.

You can also request a stipend after your talk has already been accepted, but then there are no guarantees a stipend will be available.

Our goal is to make this process as simple and straight-forward as possible, although keep in mind we reserve the right to refuse a request for any reason. If in doubt, reach out to [elixir_outreach at erlef dot org](mailto:elixir_outreach@erlef.org).

## Acknowledgements

This is a new effort for all of us involved so please be patient while we figure out the details.

If you are looking for conferences to speak at, [Dave Aronson keeps a list of CFPs closing soon](https://www.codosaur.us/speaking/cfps-ending-soon) and there are likely others available. Note we don’t necessarily endorse all conferences listed nor guarantee they meet the requirements above, but the list may help you get the ball rolling.

Thanks to Parker Selbert, Shannon Selbert, Brian Cardarella, Alistair Woodman, and Lee Barney for feedback and helping make this a reality.
