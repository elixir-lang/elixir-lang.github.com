We are pleased to announce that Elixir is taking part in Google Summer of Code 2013
as member of the [BEAM Community](http://beamcommunity.github.io). This means that
students all around the world can get paid to work on Elixir during the summer!

The rules require students to be enrolled in college full or part-time, and to be
at least 18 years by May 27, 2013. You can find more information on
[Google Summer of Code 2013 website](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013).

We have published [a list of ideas we would like to see and explore in Elixir](https://github.com/beamcommunity/beamcommunity.github.com/wiki/Project:-Elixir)
that students can use as a basis, but students are also free to send their own
proposals. If your proposal gets accepted, Google will pay you $5000 over the
course of three months to work on Elixir. Students can start submitting their
proposals on April 22 and the deadline is May 23.

Note the BEAM Community serves as a mentoring organization for many other projects
that run on the Erlang VM, including Elixir. To see the full list, [visit the website](http://beamcommunity.github.io).

We hope to work with you during this summer! If you have more questions, feel free
to join the [BEAM Community mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/beam-community)
or talk to us on `#beam-community` on irc.freenode.net.
