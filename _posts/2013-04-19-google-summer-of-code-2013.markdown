We are pleased to announce that Elixir is taking part of Google Summer of Code 2013 as member of the [BEAM Community](http://beamcommunity.github.io). This means that students all around the world can get paid to work on Elixir during the summer!

The rules require students to be enrolled full or part-time, to be at least 18 years old on or before May 27, 2013. You can find more information on [Google Summer of Code 2013 website](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013).

We have put up [a list of ideas we would like to see and explore in Elixir](https://github.com/beamcommunity/beamcommunity.github.com/wiki/Project:-Elixir) that students can use as a basis, but students are also free to send their own proposals. If your proposal gets accepted, Google will pay you $5000 over the course of three months to work on your proposal. Student can start submitting their proposals on April 22 and the deadline is May 23.

Note the [BEAM Community](http://beamcommunity.github.io) hosts other projects on the Erlang VM, so don't forget to check them out too!

We hope to work with you during this summer! If you have more questions, feel free to e-mail the [BEAM Community mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/beam-community) or talk to us on `#beam-community` on irc.freenode.net.
