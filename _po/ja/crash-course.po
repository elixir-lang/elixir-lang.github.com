msgid "### Erlang"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The fastest way to run some code is to launch the Erlang shell -- `erl`. Many "
"code snippets on this page can be pasted directly into the shell. However, whe"
"n you want to define a named function, Erlang expects it to be inside of a mod"
"ule, and modules have to be compiled. Here's a skeleton for a module:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```erlang\n"
"% module_name.erl\n"
"-module(module_name).  % you may use some other name\n"
"-compile(export_all)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"hello() ->\n"
"  io:format(\"~s~n\", [\"Hello world!\"]).\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add your functions to it, save it to disk, run `erl` from the same directory a"
"nd execute the `compile` command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```erl\n"
"Eshell V5.9  (abort with ^G)\n"
"1> c(module_name).\n"
"ok\n"
"1> module_name:hello().\n"
"Hello world!\n"
"ok\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may keep the shell running while you're editing the file. Just don't forge"
"t to execute `c(module_name)` to load the latest changes. Note that the filena"
"me has to be the same as the one declared in the `-module()` directive, plus a"
"n extension `.erl`."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Elixir"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Elixir too has an interactive shell called `iex`. Compiling Elixir code can be"
" done with `elixirc` (which is similar to Erlang's `erlc`). Elixir also provid"
"es an executable named `elixir` to run Elixir code. The module defined above c"
"an be written in Elixir as:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"# module_name.ex\n"
"defmodule ModuleName do\n"
"  def hello do\n"
"    IO.puts \"Hello World\"\n"
"  end\n"
"end\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "And compiled from `iex`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```iex\n"
"Interactive Elixir\n"
"iex> c(\"module_name.ex\")\n"
"[ModuleName]\n"
"iex> ModuleName.hello\n"
"Hello world!\n"
":ok\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However notice that in Elixir you don't need to create a file only to create a"
" new module, Elixir modules can be defined directly in the shell:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"defmodule MyModule do\n"
"  def hello do\n"

msgid "### Calling functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Invoking a function from a module uses different syntax. In Erlang, you would "
"write"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```erlang\n"
"lists:last([1, 2]).\n"

msgid "## Data types"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Erlang and Elixir have the same data types for the most part, but there are a "
"number of differences."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Atoms"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Erlang, an `atom` is any identifier that starts with a lowercase letter, e."
"g. `ok`, `tuple`, `donut`. Identifiers that start with a capital letter are al"
"ways treated as variable names. Elixir, on the other hand, uses the former for"
" naming variables, and the latter are treated as atom aliases. Atoms in Elixir"
" always start with a colon `:`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```erlang\n"
"im_an_atom.\n"

"im_a_var\n"
"x = 10"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Module  # this is called an atom alias; it expands to :'Elixir.Module'\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is also possible to create atoms that start with a character other than a l"
"owercase letter. The syntax is different between the two languages:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```erlang\n"
"is_atom(ok).                %=> true\n"
"is_atom('0_ok').            %=> true\n"

"is_atom :\"Multiple words\"   #=> true\n"
"is_atom :\"\"                 #=> true\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "### Tuples"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The syntax for tuples is the same in both languages, but the APIs are differen"
"t. Elixir attempts to normalize Erlang libraries in a way that:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"1. The `subject` of the function is always the first argument.\n"
"2. All data structures functions employ zero-based access."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That said, Elixir does not import the default `element` and `setelement` funct"
"ions, but instead provides `elem` and `put_elem`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```erlang\n"
"element(1, {a, b, c}).       %=> a\n"
"setelement(1, {a, b, c}, d). %=> {d, b, c}\n"
"```"

msgid "### Lists and binaries"
msgstr ""

msgid "Elixir has a shortcut syntax for binaries:"

"is_binary <<\"Hello\">>    #=> true\n"
"<<\"Hello\">> === \"Hello\"  #=> true\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Elixir, the word **string** means a UTF-8 binary and there is a `String` mo"
"dule that works on such data. Elixir also expects your source files to be UTF-"
"8 encoded. On the other hand, **string** in Erlang refers to char lists and th"
"ere is a `:string` module, that's not UTF-8 aware and works mostly with char l"
"ists."
msgstr ""

msgid "Elixir also supports multiline strings (also called *heredocs*):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""

"spanning several\n"
"lines.\n"
"\"\"\"\n"
"#=> true\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "### Keyword list"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Elixir offers a literal syntax for creating a list of two-item tuples where th"
"e first item in the tuple is an atom and calls them keyword lists:"
msgstr ""

"#=> 20\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "### Maps"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Erlang R17 introduced maps, a key-value store, with no ordering. Keys and valu"
"es can be any term. Creating, updating and matching maps in both languages is "
"shown below:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```erlang\n"
"Map = #{key => 0}.\n"

"#=> true\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the keys are all atoms, Elixir allows developers to use `key: 0` for defini"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"map = %{key: 0}\n"
"map = %{map | key: 1}\n"
"map.key === 1\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "### Regular expressions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Elixir supports a literal syntax for regular expressions. Such syntax allows r"
"egexes to be compiled at compilation time instead of runtime and does not requ"
"ire you to double escape special regex characters:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```erlang\n"
"{ ok, Pattern } = re:compile(\"abc\\\\s\").\n"
"re:run(\"abc \", Pattern).\n"
