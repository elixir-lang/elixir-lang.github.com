#: ../../../_posts/2013-12-15-elixir-v0-12-0-released.markdown:13
msgid "In previous versions, the Enumerable protocol was based on reduce/fold, and while it is very efficient for operations like `map`, `reduce` and `filter`, it was sub-optimal for operations that need to halt, like `take` and `take_while`, and it made it impossible for operations like `zip` to be implemented."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2013-12-15-elixir-v0-12-0-released.markdown:15
msgid "In v0.12.0, Elixir's Enumerable protocol has been extended to allow suspension and halting mechanisms, making operations like `take` simpler and operations that require interleaving, like `zip`, possible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2013-12-15-elixir-v0-12-0-released.markdown:17
msgid "Although most users don't need to concern with the implementation of the Enumerable protocol, the side-effect is that both `Enum` and `Stream` modules have been considerably extended and improved in this release, with more than 15 new functions added to the `Stream` module."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2013-12-15-elixir-v0-12-0-released.markdown:21
msgid "The tool that received most improvements in this release was Mix. The biggest change is that Mix no longer compiles projects in place but to the `_build` directory. For example, take the [Ecto project](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ecto) that [depends on `postgrex` and `poolboy`](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ecto/blob/master/mix.exs#L24-L25). When compiled, all the artifacts will be placed in the `_build` directory like this:"

msgid "For those familiar with Erlang's OTP, this is similar to the structure used by OTP when releasing your software. So this new structure makes our software one step close to production and guarantee it is designed correctly since day 1."

msgid "This approach comes with the `:build_per_environment` option which, when set to true, creates a different build per environment (`dev`, `test`, `production` or more). Extremely useful when a project compile different artifacts depending on the compilation environment."
