msgid "## What's Elixir?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and ma"
"intainable applications."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and"
" fault-tolerant systems, while also being successfully used in web development"
" and the embedded software domain."
msgstr ""

msgid "## What's new?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This release is the consolidation of all the work done through the years. With"
" v1.0, we have reached a stable milestone for the growth of software and proje"
"cts written in Elixir."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Elixir will follow [semantic versioning](http://semver.org), which means code "
"written for Elixir v1.0 will continue to compile and run correctly for all ver"
"sions under the v1 branch (e.g. v1.0.1, v1.1.0, v1.2.0)."
msgstr ""

"Elixir is composed of 6 applications, all under the same versioning constraint"
"s:"

"  * [Elixir](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/) - the Elixir compiler, runtime and th"
"e standard library\n"
"  * [EEx](https://hexdocs.pm/eex/) - Elixir's templating library, useful for g"
"enerating any kind of document dynamically\n"
"  * [ExUnit](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/) - Elixir's unit test library, with s"
"upport for concurrent testing, custom formatters, filters and much more\n"
"  * [IEx](https://hexdocs.pm/iex/) - Elixir's interactive shell with code relo"
"ading, auto-complete, and easy access to documentation, typespecs and more\n"
"  * [Logger](https://hexdocs.pm/logger/) - the latest addition to the group, L"
"ogger provides reliable logging and configurable backends (with syslog, file a"
"nd many other backends provided by the community)\n"
"  * [Mix](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/) - Elixir's build tool that generates, compi"
"les and tests projects as well as manages your dependencies"

msgid "## Expectations"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We would like to elaborate on the expectations regarding Elixir v1.0. Although"
" we expect that the vast majority of programs will remain compatible over time"
", it is impossible to guarantee that no future change will break any program."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Under some unlikely circumstances, we may introduce changes that break existin"
"g code:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  * Security: a security issue in the implementation may arise whose resolutio"
"n requires backwards incompatible changes. We reserve the right to address suc"
"h security issues."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  * Bugs: if an application has undesired behaviour, a program that depends on"
" the buggy behaviour may break if the bug is fixed. We reserve the right to fi"
"x such bugs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  * Compiler front-end: improvements may be done to the compiler, introducing "
"new warnings for ambiguous modes and providing more detailed error messages. T"
"hose can lead to compilation errors (when running with `--warning-as-errors`) "
"or tooling failures when asserting on specific error messages (although one sh"
"ould avoid such). We reserve the right to do such improvements."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  * Imports: new functions may be added to the Kernel module, which is auto-im"
"ported. They may collide with local functions defined in your modules. Collisi"
"ons can be resolved in a backwards compatible fashion using `import Kernel, ex"
"cept: [...]` with a list of all functions you don't want imported from Kernel."
" We reserve the right to do such additions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Elixir binaries are guaranteed to be backwards compatible within the same bran"
"ch. Code compiled with v1.0 shall work with Elixir v1.0.1 runtime but code com"
"piled with Elixir v1.0 should be recompiled to work with Elixir v1.1.0 onwards"
"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These expectations also apply to future releases under the v1 branch, except f"
"or experimental features, which will be explicitly marked as such and not prov"
"ide any compatibility guarantee until they are stabilized."
