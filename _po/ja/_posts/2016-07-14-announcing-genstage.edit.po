In the short-term, we expect GenStage to replace the use cases for GenEvent as well as providing a composable abstraction for consuming data from third-party systems."

For those unfamiliar with GenEvent, it is a behaviour where events are sent to an \"event manager\" which then proceeds to invoke \"event handlers\" for each event. GenEvent, however, has one big flaw: the event manager and all event handlers run in the same process. This means GenEvent handlers cannot easily leverage concurrency without forcing developers to implement those mechanisms themselves. Furthermore, GenEvent handlers have very awkward error semantics. Because event handlers are not separate processes, we cannot simply rely on supervisors restarting them."

The code itself is coming in future GenStage releases.

In other words, a dataset that takes 60s with a single core, takes 36s on a machine with 2 cores and 18s in one with 4 cores. All of those gains by simply moving your computations from streams to Flow. We plan to benchmark on machines with over 40 cores soon."
