msgid "Elixir v1.4 brings new features, enhancements and bug fixes. The most notable changes are the addition of the `Registry` module, the `Task.async_stream/3` and `Task.async_stream/5` function which aid developers in writing concurrent software, and the new application inference and commands added to Mix."

msgid "The [`Registry`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Registry.html) is a new module in Elixir's standard library that allows Elixir developers to implement patterns such as name lookups, code dispatching or even a pubsub system in a simple and scalable way."
msgstr ""

msgid "Broadly speaking, the Registry is a local, decentralized and scalable key-value process storage. Let's break this in parts:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2017-01-05-elixir-v1-4-0-released.markdown:19
msgid ""
"  * Local because keys and values are only accessible to the current node (opposite to distributed)\n"
"  * Decentralized because there is no single entity responsible for managing the registry\n"
"  * Scalable because performance scales linearly with the addition of more cores upon partitioning"

msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2017-01-05-elixir-v1-4-0-released.markdown:60
msgid "However, the snippet above will spawn and run concurrently as many tasks as there are items in the collection. While this may be fine in many occasions, including small collections, sometimes it is necessary to restrict amount of tasks running concurrently, specially when shared resources are involved."

For this reason, escripts is the preferred format for sharing executables."
