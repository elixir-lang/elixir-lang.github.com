msgid "Elixir v0.9.0 also removes support for Erlang R15 and earlier versions. In case you still need to run Elixir software on R15, we have also released Elixir v0.8.3, which contains many of the enhancements in v0.9.0. Check the [CHANGELOG for more details for both releases](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/v0.9.0/CHANGELOG.md)."

The issue so far was that Elixir did not provide good support for working with many applications at once, and compiling and managing those applications became rather a tedious work."

"* Iterators are very hard to compose;\n"
"* Iterators contain state. You need to know, at each moment, what is the next element you have to iterate next. We use functions and their bindings to pass the iteration state around;\n"
"* Iterators have the \"dangling open resource\" problem. Consider that you want to iterate a file with `Enum.map/2` as above. If any step during the iteration fails, there is no easy way to notify the resource being iterated  (in this case, the opened file) that iteration failed, so we can't close the file automatically, leaving it to the user."

"* Reducers are composable (notice how we have implemented map on top of reduce by composing functions);\n"
"* Reducers are self-contained: there is no need keep state around, which also solves the \"dangling open resource\" problem. The data type now knows exactly when the iteration starts and when it finishes;\n"
"* Reducers do not dictate how a type should be enumerated. This means types like `Range` and `HashDict` can provide a much faster implementation for Reducers;\n"
"* Furthermore, the end result is a cleaner implementation of most of `Enum` functions (the [reducers pull request](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/1102) removes over 500LOC) and better performance!"

This is very useful for testing how your software reacts to some inputs and what it prints to the terminal;\n"
"* `IEx` now allows files to be imported into the shell with `import_file` and also loads `~/.iex` on startup for custom configuration;\n"
"* The `String`, `Enum` and `Dict` modules got more convenience functions that goes from checking unicode character validity to taking values out of a dictionary;\n"
"* And many, many more!"
