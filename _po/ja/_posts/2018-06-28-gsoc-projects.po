"Like previous years, the Elixir community is happy to participate in [Google S"
"ummer of Code][gsoc] 2018. We are currently working on four different projects"
". Let's have a look at them."
msgstr ""

msgid "## StreamData integration with typespecs"
msgstr ""

msgid "*Student: Nikola Jichev*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"[StreamData][stream_data] is a data-generation and property-based testing libr"
"ary for Elixir. The goal of this GSoC project is to integrate StreamData with "
"typespecs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The data-generation side of StreamData provides tools to generate random data "
"through composable generators. For example, you could generate keyword lists l"
"ike this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"import StreamData"
msgstr ""

msgid "keywords_generator = list_of({atom(:alphanumeric), term()})"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Enum.take(keywords_generator, 2)\n"
"#=> [[_: [true]], [tm: 2, h: %{}]]\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In many cases, it would be useful to be able to generate such random data star"
"ting from already existing or user-defined types. For example, Elixir already "
"provides a built-in `keyword/0` type for keyword lists defined roughly as:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"@type keyword() :: [{atom(), any()}]\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The goal of the first part of this GSoC project is to provide StreamData with "
"the ability to create data generators from type definitions. The API is not ye"
"t defined, but in this case, it could look something like the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "keywords_generator = from_type(keyword/0)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the second part of the GSoC project, the aim is to be able to property-test"
" functions with specs automatically."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"@spec has_key?(keyword(), atom()) :: boolean()\n"
"def has_key?(keyword, key) do\n"
"  # ...\n"
"end\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first part of the project focuses on generating data from types, so we kno"
"w how to generate function arguments. The missing piece is **validating** that"
" a given term *belongs to* a given type. For example, in the snippet above, we"
" want to be able to check if a term is a `boolean()`. Once we're able to do th"
"is, automatic spec validation will be straightforward: it will be a matter of "
"generating random arguments for the given function, calling the function with "
"those arguments, and asserting that the returned value belongs to the return t"
"ype defined in the spec."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This kind of property-based testing doesn't test for *correctness*. In the sni"
"ppet above, `has_key?/2` could be implemented to ignore arguments always retur"
"n `false` and the automatic spec validation would pass since `false` is always"
" a boolean. However, this is a kind of **smoke testing** useful for discoverin"
"g inconsistencies in the arguments and return values of functions."

msgid "## Tensorflex: Tensorflow bindings for the Elixir programming language"
msgstr ""

msgid "*Student: Anshuman Chhabra*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Currently, there is a lack of machine learning tools and frameworks for Elixir"
". With the number of programmers learning/using machine learning only set to g"
"row, supporting machine learning capabilities is essential for any programming"
" language. Moreover, there are discussions on [ElixirForum][elixirforum] regar"
"ding this and recent talks given at ElixirConf that reflect the need for Elixi"
"r to provide machine learning capabilities."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This project's goal is Tensorflex, an Elixir machine learning framework simila"
"r to [Keras for Python][keras]. Keras uses Tensorflow as a backend for doing a"
"ll the machine learning. Tensorflex will use Using Native Implemented Function"
"s (NIFs) and the Tensorflow C API as a backend to provide a low-level API. Thi"
"s low-level API will then be used to write a Keras-like framework in the form "
"of a high-level API. This will allow Elixir developers to write expedient and "
"efficient machine learning code in Elixir."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Dialyzer task for Elixir"
msgstr ""

msgid "*Student: Gabriel Gatu*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Dialyzer is a discrepancy analyzer that ships as part of Erlang/OTP. Currently"
", there are two projects that add Dialyzer support to Elixir applications: [di"
"alyxir][] and [dialyzex][]. The goal of this project is to bring ideas from bo"
"th projects into Elixir itself in order to make using Dialyzer in Elixir proje"
"cts easier. The task we aim to add to Elixir will focus on two main features: "
"better user experience (in particular, better error messages and formatting) a"
"nd the ability to analyze projects incrementally."
msgstr ""

msgid "## ElixirBench"
msgstr ""

msgid "*Student: Tallys Martins*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"ElixirBench aims to be a service to monitor performance of Elixir projects. Th"
"e goal of the GSoC project is to bring ElixirBench up and have it run nightly "
"performance monitoring of significant Elixir projects (including Elixir itself"
"). The end goal is to have a platform that, given a project from GitHub, will "
"monitor the performance of new releases of that project and look for performan"
"ce regressions. The benchmarking process will be controlled through a configur"
"ation file that will specify the benchmark scripts to run."
msgstr ""

" and for core Elixir projects alike."
