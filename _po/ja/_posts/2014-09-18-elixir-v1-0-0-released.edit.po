#: ../../../_posts/2014-09-18-elixir-v1-0-0-released.markdown:46
msgid "  * Compiler front-end: improvements may be done to the compiler, introducing new warnings for ambiguous modes and providing more detailed error messages. Those can lead to compilation errors (when running with `--warning-as-errors`) or tooling failures when asserting on specific error messages (although one should avoid such). We reserve the right to do such improvements."

Collisions can be resolved in a backwards compatible fashion using `import Kernel, except: [...]` with a list of all functions you don't want imported from Kernel. We reserve the right to do such additions."
