msgid "Elixir v1.5 includes new features, enhancements, and bug fixes. While [Elixir v1.4](/blog/2017/01/05/elixir-v1-4-0-released/) focused on tools for concurrency and scalability, Elixir v1.5 brings many improvements to the developer experience and quality of life. As we will see, many of those are powered by the latest Erlang/OTP 20. This is also the last Elixir release that supports Erlang/OTP 18."

From there, we can either set more breakpoints, remove existing breakpoints and continue execution. The session ended by calling `open`, which will open your editor at the file and line under debugging. `open/1` can also be invoked by passing any module or function, and IEx will open your editor at that place."
