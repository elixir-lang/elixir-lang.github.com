"After 4 months, Elixir v0.11.0 has been released with 832 commits since the pr"
"evious minor release, done by more than 40 contributors. Although we have some"
" great features in this release, the major focus in those 4 months was improvi"
"ng the common patterns used by the community and streamlining the existing wor"
"kflows."

msgid "## IEx"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of the tools that most received improvements in this release was our inter"
"active shell. Such improvements come as no surprise as Elixir developers spend"
" a good amount of time in the shell, which is great for development, allowing "
"you to quickly try and load code, to production, where IEx can connect to remo"
"te nodes to inspect production information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The IEx helper `h`, responsible for showing documentation for existing modules"
" and functions, has now been improved to rely on ANSI codes and nicely format "
"the documentation. let's take a look at the docs for the String module:"
msgstr ""

msgid "![String module docs](/images/contents/string-help.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This change goes in line with Elixir's goal of providing first-class documenta"
"tion, which makes documentation easily accessible at runtime, support to docte"
"sts and more."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this new release, IEx also supports a very simple debugging mechanism calle"
"d `IEx.pry`. Let's see an screenshot of it in action:"
msgstr ""

msgid "![IEx pry example](/images/contents/iex-pry.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Elixir, your code runs in many processes that talk to each other and the El"
"ixir shell is no different. `IEx.pry` allows another process to take over the "
"shell, allowing the developer to inspect the binding and halt the execution of"
" the process being \"pried\" (i.e. the one that invoked `IEx.pry`). We called th"
"is feature `pry` as a gentle reminder that you can only inspect existing infor"
"mation, you cannot change the binding over a pried process. For more informati"
"on, check the docs for [`IEx.pry/1`](https://hexdocs.pm/iex/IEx.html#pry/1)."

msgid "## ExUnit"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"[In the previous release](/blog/2013/07/13/elixir-v0-10-0-released/), we intro"
"duced great changes to ExUnit, like the support for the `--trace` option. This"
" time we continued pushing improvements, like adding profiling to test cases ("
"times can be seen with the `--trace` option), paving the way for other feature"
"s like emitting warnings for test cases that are too slow."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another simple but significant change in ExUnit was the change in the default "
"formatter to print changes as they come, instead of waiting until the suite is"
" done running:"
msgstr ""

msgid "![ExUnit Fast Fail](/images/contents/fast-fail.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid "This change allows developer to get faster feedback from their test suites."

msgid "## Mix"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since the early days, Elixir took ahold of the compilation process in order to"
" provide a seamless compilation experience. [Elixir's ParallelCompiler](/blog/"
"2012/04/24/a-peek-inside-elixir-s-parallel-compiler/) was introduced even befo"
"re the first official release, allowing developers to harness all the cores in"
" their computer to compile Elixir code. However, once the first release came o"
"ut, every time you changed any file, the whole project had to be recompiled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the past releases we have improved this process to only compile files that "
"changed and their dependencies. For v0.11.0, we have improved this process to "
"be faster and less conservative than the previous version."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mix has also improved support for umbrella projects, which are projects that c"
"ontain multiple OTP applications, essential for building large projects. The c"
"urrent release allows sharing of dependencies between projects and faster and "
"dependency resolution times."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Other changes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This release also introduces the new capture operator, which provides a conven"
"ient syntax for retrieving functions so they can be passed as arguments:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"Enum.all?([:foo, :bar, :baz], &is_atom/1)\n"
"#=> true\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "Which can also be used for partially applying functions and macros:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"fun = &is_record(&1, Range)\n"
"fun.(1..3)\n"
"#=> true\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can learn more about the [new capture operator in our docs](https://hexdoc"
"s.pm/elixir/Kernel.SpecialForms.html#&/1)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We have also pushed improvements to [the String module](https://hexdocs.pm/eli"
"xir/String.html), including new APIs. In particular, in order to know that `St"
"ring.length(\"josé\")` has length 4 (even though it takes 5 bytes to be represen"
"ted in UTF-8), we need to use some algorithms defined by the Unicode Standard."
" These have been implemented as specified in the [extended grapheme cluster al"
"gorithm, defined in the version 6.3.0 of the Unicode Standard](http://www.unic"
"ode.org/reports/tr29/)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the optimization front, we have pushed the first iteration of a [feature ca"
"lled Protocol consolidation](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/elixir-la"
"ng-core/RoXAUtoyjk4), which speeds up the polymorphic dispatch done by protoco"
"ls, sometimes reducing the dispatching time to 10% of the original time. We wi"
"ll continue working in upcoming releases to integrate protocol consolidation a"
"s a regular part of the developer workflow."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"And finally, a minor but frequently asked feature has finally arrived into Eli"
"xir: variables follow the same rules as other identifiers in the language, whi"
"ch means developers can now name their variables `is_atom?`. For a general ove"
"rview, [check out the CHANGELOG](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/v0"
".11.0/CHANGELOG.md)."

"**PS:** We have just released v0.11.1 which addresses a regression in Mix and "
