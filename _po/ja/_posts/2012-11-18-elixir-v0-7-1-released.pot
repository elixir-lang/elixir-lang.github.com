Developers from different backgrounds have shown interest in Elixir, [written about it](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2012/10/31/elixir-erlang-and-the-dining-philosophers/), joined us at #elixir-lang on freenode and contributed to the language. As of today, Elixir is powered by 51 different contributors!"
