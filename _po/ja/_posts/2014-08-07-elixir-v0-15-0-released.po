"We are glad to announce v0.15.0 has been released. We have spent the last 2 mo"
"nths tidying up the existing APIs, ensuring consistency, improving performance"
" and more. As a result, v0.15.0 is the last minor branch before Elixir v1.0!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are also no more planned deprecations nor backward incompatible changes "
"which means it is extremely likely that code that runs on v0.15.0 will run exa"

"If you are interested in the specific details for this release, [please check "
"our CHANGELOG](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/v0.15.0/CHANGELOG.md"
"). In this post, we will focus on three new features in this release: Logger, "
"Mix aliases, the fresh Elixir Web Installer for Windows, and share some exciti"
"ng news at the end!"

msgid "## Logger"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Elixir now ships with a new application called logger. This application provid"

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"require Logger\n"
"Logger.debug \"hello\"\n"

msgid "By default, the code above will log the following message to your console:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```\n"
"10:27:39.083 [debug] hello\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Logger provides multiple backends to where messages are logged. For now Elixir"
" ships only with a console backend but there are developers already working on"
" file (with support to external log rotation) and [syslog](https://en.wikipedi"
"a.org/wiki/Syslog) backends."

msgid ""
"When we started Logger, the main objective was to translate Erlang messages in"

"As soon as we started working on Logger, we realized we could go further than "
"simply translating Erlang messages and provide a fully featured logger library"
". At this moment, Logger also supports:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  * 4 log levels: debug, info, warn and error\n"
"  * Custom formatting: you can specify a format string that tells exactly how "
"messages should be logged. The default string is: \"$time $metadata[$level] $me"
"ssage\n"
"\" but [many attributes are supported](https://hexdocs.pm/logger/Logger.Formatt"
"er.html)\n"
"  * Custom translators: so you can translate log messages coming from any Erla"
"ng application into Elixir syntax\n"
"  * Metadata: metadata allows developers to store information in the current p"
"rocess that will be available to all logged messages. For example, a web appli"
"cation can generate a `request_id`, store it as metadata, and all messages log"
"ged during that request will be properly identified with `request_id=...` in t"
"he log"

msgid ""
"We have also relied a lot on the [research and work done by Andrew Thompson an"
"d the folks at Basho behind Lager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BNpOHFvg_Q"
") to ensure our logger is performant and robust. On this front, Logger"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  * alternates between sync and async modes when logging messages to keep it p"
"erformant when required but also apply back-pressure when under stress\n"
"  * formats and truncates messages on the client to avoid clogging the backend"

"We are looking forward to everyone's feedback on using Logger more and more in"
" production."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Mix aliases"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mix is Elixir's build tool. Mix knows how to manage your dependencies, compile"
" & test your projects and much more. We have designed Mix, since day one, to b"
"e extensible. Developers were always able to define new tasks by simply defini"
"ng a module:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"defmodule Mix.Tasks.Hello do\n"
"  use Mix.Task"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  def run(_) do\n"
"    IO.puts \"Hello world\"\n"
"  end\n"
"end\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "The task above can now be invoked as `mix hello`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Defining custom Mix tasks is useful for projects and libraries that want to be"
"tter integrate with the standard development workflow for Elixir. However, it "
"is a bit verbose for creating one-off tasks or tasks to be used only locally i"
"n a given project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Furthermore, so far Mix did not allow developers to extend existing tasks. For"
" example, imagine you want to perform some extra work when `mix clean` is invo"
"ked. Up to this release, it was not possible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mix aliases solve both problems by providing a simple API for defining and ove"
"rriding aliases. All projects that use Mix contain a `mix.exs` file with the p"
"roject configuration. In order to define an alias, you just need to add a new "
"key to your project configuration:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"defmodule MyProject do\n"
"  use Mix.Project"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  def project do\n"
"    [app: :my_project,\n"
"     aliases: aliases]\n"
"  end"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  defp aliases do\n"
"    [c: \"compile\",\n"
"     hello: &print_hello/1,\n"
"     clean: [\"clean\", &clean_vendor/1]]\n"
"  end"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  defp print_hello(_),  do: IO.puts \"Hello world\"\n"
"  defp clean_vendor(_), do: File.rm_rf!(\"vendor\")\n"
"end\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "In the project above, we have defined three aliases:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  1. `mix c` - is now a shortcut to `mix compile`\n"
"  2. `mix hello` - is equivalent to the `Mix.Tasks.Hello` we have defined earl"
"ier, although now it is more easily defined as an alias\n"
"  3. `mix clean` - extends the existing `clean` task to ensure we invoke `clea"
"n_vendor/1` afterwards"
msgstr ""

msgid "In other words, aliases can be three different structures:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  1. A string containing the task and arguments to be invoked\n"
"  2. An anonymous function (that is invoked passing the task arguments)\n"
"  3. A list containing strings or anonymous functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can find more information about aliases by reading the [Mix documentation]"
"(https://hexdocs.pm/mix/) (there is a section about Aliases around the middle)"
"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We also would like to thank [Anthony Grimes](https://github.com/raynes) for th"
"e support and [Phil Halgelberg](https://github.com/technomancy) for [the work "

"At the beginning of this summer, [Chris Hyndman](https://github.com/chyndman) "

"  * Ensuring important projects like our [C markdown processor](https://github"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Chris has also built an [Elixir Web Installer for Windows](https://github.com/"
"elixir-lang/elixir-windows-setup). The web installer checks all available Elix"
"ir versions and allows you to pick which one to install. It will also fetch an"
"d install Erlang in your machine in case it has not been installed yet."

"If you want to give Elixir and the Web Installer a try, you can [download the "
"current version here](https://repo.hex.pm/elixir-websetup.exe). And, if [Choco"
