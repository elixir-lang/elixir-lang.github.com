While it's true that random data generation can't cover all the possible values that a piece of code can deal with, the confidence in your codebase can still increase over time because the property-based tests will likely generate different values on each run. Example-based testing means your test data will not change over time."

One of the most famous and complete tools for property-based testing exists for Erlang itself: [QuickCheck][] by Quviq is a complete commercial solution for property-based testing in Erlang of both stateless as well as stateful systems, and Quviq even provides a custom Erlang scheduler to test race conditions in your concurrent programs."

"> * We wanted to add both data generation and property testing to Elixir. That's why the library is called stream_data instead of something named after property tests. The goal is to reduce the learning curve behind property testing by exposing the data generation aspect as streams, which is a known construct to most Elixir developers. We had this approach in mind for a while and the first library we saw leveraging this in practice was [@pragdave's pollution][pollution].\n"
"> * Finally, since the core team are taking the responsibility of maintaining property testing as part of Elixir for potentially the rest of our lives, we want to have full understanding of every single line of code. This is non-negotiable as it guarantees we can continue to consistently improve the code as we move forward.\n"
