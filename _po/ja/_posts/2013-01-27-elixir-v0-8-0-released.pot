msgid "For last but not least, Elixir ships with a [new HashDict implementation](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/master/lib/elixir/lib/hash_dict.ex). In Erlang, there are different key-value store implementations and often you need to pick which one is the best for you based on the average size of the dictionary. Generally speaking, [orddicts](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/orddict.html) are efficient and fast when you want to hold a handful of items, otherwise you should consider [gb_trees](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/gb_trees.html) unless you want to hold thousands of items, when then [dict](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/dict.html) becomes your best option. The fact those implementations do not provide the same API, makes it harder to change your code when you realize another implementation would be better fit."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2013-01-27-elixir-v0-8-0-released.markdown:83
msgid "For Elixir, we decided to have a single dictionary implementation that would scale as needed. It would start as a compact representation for a handful of items and expand and rehash accordingly as new items are added or removed, providing fast access and modification times on all ranges. We are glad to say our goals were reached and a new `HashDict` implementation ships with Elixir v0.8."

#: ../../../_posts/2013-01-27-elixir-v0-8-0-released.markdown:91
msgid "For each number of keys, we have measured and normalized those values against `HashDict` results. This way it is easy to see which implementation takes more or less time compared to Elixir's implementation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2013-01-27-elixir-v0-8-0-released.markdown:93
msgid "`orddict` is still the faster representation for small ranges since it is a simple list. However, `HashDict` is able to be relatively fast compared to `orddict` for those small ranges and the fastest solution once you have dozens of keys. [Those results can be verified when using other types as keys as well](https://gist.github.com/436a9d2bca5051a6dfab)."
