msgid "Maps naturally solve issues `1.` and `2.` above. In particular, maps that have same keys share the same key-space in memory. That's why the update operation `%{map | ...}` we have seen above is relevant: if we know we are updating an existing key, the new map created as result of the update operation can share the same key space as the old map without extra checks. For more details on why Maps are efficient, I would recommend [reading Joe's blog post on the matter](http://joearms.github.io/2014/02/01/big-changes-to-erlang.html)."

msgid "* Integrate applications configuration (provided by OTP) right into Mix;\n"
"* Provide an Elixir logger that knows how to print and format Elixir exceptions and stacktraces;\n"
"* Properly expose the functionality provided by Applications, Supervisors, GenServers and GenEvents and study how they can integrate with Elixir. For example, how to consume events from GenEvent as a [stream of data](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html)?\n"
"* Study how patterns like tasks and agents can be integrated into the language, often picking up the lessons learned by libraries like [e2](http://e2project.org/erlang.html) and [functionality exposed by OTP itself](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/rpc.html);\n"
"* Rewrite the Mix and ExUnit guides to focus on applications and OTP as a whole, rebranding it to \"Building Apps with Mix and OTP\";"
