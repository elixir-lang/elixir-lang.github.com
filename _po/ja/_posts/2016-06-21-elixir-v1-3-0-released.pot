The most notable additions are the new Calendar types, the new cross-reference checker in Mix, and the assertion diffing in ExUnit. We will explore all of them and a couple more enhancements below."

msgid "Speaking about warnings, Mix v1.3 includes a new task called `xref` that performs cross reference checks in your code. One of such checks is the ability to find calls to modules and functions that do not exist. For example, if in your library code you call `ThisModuleDoesNotExist.foo(1, 2, 3)`, `mix xref unreachable` will be able to find such code and let you know about it."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2016-06-21-elixir-v1-3-0-released.markdown:127
msgid "Besides `xref`, Elixir v1.3 provides better module tracking generally. For example, in previous versions, if you changed a `:path` dependency, Elixir would always fully recompile the current project. In this release, we have improved the tracking algorithms such that, if you change a `:path` dependency, only the files that depend on such dependency are recompiled."
