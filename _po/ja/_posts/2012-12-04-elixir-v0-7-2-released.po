"Hot out of the oven! We just released Elixir v0.7.2 with a number of delicious"
" improvements."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of the most important changes in this minor release is a partial rehaul of"
"\n"
"the type specification syntax."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here's the gist:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"@spec myfun(integer), do: integer\n"
"# becomes\n"
"@spec myfun(integer) :: integer"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"@type a :: fun\n"
"# becomes\n"
"@type a :: (... -> any) or ((...) -> any) or (fun(...) -> any)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"@type a :: fun(do: integer)\n"
"# becomes\n"
"@type a :: (() -> integer) or (fun() -> integer)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"@type a :: fun(integer, do: integer)\n"
"# becomes\n"
"@type a :: (integer -> integer) or ((integer) -> integer) or (fun(integer) -> "
"integer)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"@type a :: fun(integer, integer, do: integer)\n"
"# becomes\n"
"@type a :: (integer, integer -> integer) or ((integer, integer) -> integer) or"
" (fun(integer, integer) -> integer)\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another change is that Mix now echoes the output of external tools\n"
"such as git and rebar, and handles exit status correctly. This have previously"
"\n"
"led to some less-than-perfect workflows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We've also added a more compact and visual form of the `function` helper. Now,"
"\n"
"instead of `function(Enum, :all?, 2)` you can use `function(Enum.all?/2)`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We've also figured out how to achieve an up to 6x [performance increase](https"
"://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/v0.7.2/lib/elixir/lib/kernel.ex#L1386-L1"
"417)\n"
"under some circunstances when using records."

"...and [many other fixes & improvements](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir"

"Lastly, but not least importantly, I'd like to mention that we're very excited"
" about how the community around Elixir is building up. Thank you all for being"
