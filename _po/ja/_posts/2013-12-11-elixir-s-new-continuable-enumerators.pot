"resource (lines from a file) by putting the thing that is traversed in control.\n"
"That is if you're reading from a file you have a loop that reads lines from a\n"
"file and for each line calls a function. Just calling a function isn't all that\n"
"useful for most tasks as there'd be no way to remember previous lines (ugly\n"
"hacks aside), so some accumulator value is passed to the function and a new\n"
