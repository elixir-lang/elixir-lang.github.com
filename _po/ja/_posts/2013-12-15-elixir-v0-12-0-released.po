"Elixir v0.12.0 has been released with improved enumerables, build patterns and"
" welcoming a new member to our team."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Enumerables"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In previous versions, the Enumerable protocol was based on reduce/fold, and wh"
"ile it is very efficient for operations like `map`, `reduce` and `filter`, it "
"was sub-optimal for operations that need to halt, like `take` and `take_while`"
", and it made it impossible for operations like `zip` to be implemented."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In v0.12.0, Elixir's Enumerable protocol has been extended to allow suspension"
" and halting mechanisms, making operations like `take` simpler and operations "
"that require interleaving, like `zip`, possible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Although most users don't need to concern with the implementation of the Enume"
"rable protocol, the side-effect is that both `Enum` and `Stream` modules have "
"been considerably extended and improved in this release, with more than 15 new"
" functions added to the `Stream` module."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Mix"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The tool that received most improvements in this release was Mix. The biggest "
"change is that Mix no longer compiles projects in place but to the `_build` di"
"rectory. For example, take the [Ecto project](https://github.com/elixir-lang/e"
"cto) that [depends on `postgrex` and `poolboy`](https://github.com/elixir-lang"
"/ecto/blob/master/mix.exs#L24-L25). When compiled, all the artifacts will be p"
"laced in the `_build` directory like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```\n"
"_build\n"
"└── shared\n"
"    └── lib\n"
"        ├── ecto\n"
"        │   └── ebin\n"
"        |   └── priv\n"
"        ├── poolboy\n"
"        │   └── ebin\n"
"        └── postgrex\n"
"            └── ebin\n"
"```"

msgid ""
"For those familiar with Erlang's OTP, this is similar to the structure used by"
" OTP when releasing your software. So this new structure makes our software on"
"e step close to production and guarantee it is designed correctly since day 1."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This approach comes with the `:build_per_environment` option which, when set t"
"o true, creates a different build per environment (`dev`, `test`, `production`"
" or more). Extremely useful when a project compile different artifacts dependi"
"ng on the compilation environment."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mix has also added support to optional dependencies and improved common patter"
"ns, like the usage of umbrella apps."

") to the Elixir Team. He has done fantastic work on Elixir, helping us maintai"
"n the codebase and working on many of the important features from previous rel"
"eases and now many more to come."

"d [Postgrex](https://github.com/ericmj/postgrex) projects. Which are proving t"
"o be very useful to the Elixir community too!"
