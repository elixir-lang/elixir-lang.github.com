msgid "## Documentation metadata"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Elixir v1.7 implements [EEP 48](http://erlang.org/eep/eeps/eep-0048.html). EEP"
" 48 aims to bring documentation interoperability across all languages running "
"on the Erlang VM."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Furthermore, EEP 48 introduces the ability to annotate documentation with meta"
"data, which we have made possible to leverage from Elixir:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"@moduledoc \"A brand new module\"\n"
"@moduledoc authors: [\"Jane\", \"Mary\"], since: \"1.4.0\"\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "Metadata can be given to `@moduledoc`, `@typedoc` and `@doc`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We have updated [the ExDoc tool](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc) to sta"
"rt leveraging metadata in order to provide better documentation for developers"
". Some of the improvements include:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  * Deprecated modules, functions, callbacks and types have a warning automati"
"cally attached to them. [See the deprecated `Behaviour` module as an example]("
"https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Behaviour.html)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  * Functions, macros, callbacks and types now include the version in which th"
"ey were added. For example, [see the top right corner of the `defguard` docs]("
"https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.html#defguard/1)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  * Future Elixir versions will [include its own section for guards in the doc"
"umentation and in the sidebar](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/master/Kernel.html#gu"
"ards). We are currently exploring ways to [generalize this feature in ExDoc it"
"self](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc/issues/876)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Elixir's interactive shell, IEx, has also been updated to print metadata:"
msgstr ""

msgid "![IEx metadata](/images/contents/iex-metadata.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While Elixir allows any metadata to be given, those tools currently exhibit on"
"ly `:deprecated` and `:since`. Other keys may be shown in the future."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Those improvements are not exclusive to the standard library, they are availab"
"le to every Elixir library and application. We hope one day they will be avail"
"able to all applications running on the Erlang VM too."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To access the new documentation format, developers should use [`Code.fetch_doc"
"s/1`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Code.html#fetch_docs/1). We have always been p"
"roud of treating documentation as a first-class citizen and the ability to add"
" structured information to the documentation is a further step in this directi"
"on."
msgstr ""

msgid "## The `__STACKTRACE__` construct"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Erlang/OTP 21.0 introduces a new way to retrieve the stacktrace that is lexica"
"lly scoped and no longer relies on side-effects like `System.stacktrace/0` doe"
"s. Before one would write:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"try do\n"
"  ... something that may fail ...\n"
"rescue\n"
"  exception ->\n"
"    log(exception, System.stacktrace())\n"
"    reraise(exception, System.stacktrace())\n"
"end\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "In Elixir v1.7, this can be written as:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"try do\n"
"  ... something that may fail ...\n"
"rescue\n"
"  exception ->\n"
"    log(exception, __STACKTRACE__)\n"
"    reraise(exception, __STACKTRACE__)\n"
"end\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This change may also yield performance improvements in the future, since the l"
"exical scope allows us to track precisely when a stacktrace is used and we no "
"longer need to keep references to stacktrace entries after the `try` construct"
" finishes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Other parts of the exception system have also been improved. For example, more"
" information is provided in certain occurrences of `ArgumentError`, `Arithmeti"
"cError` and `KeyError` messages."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Erlang/OTP logger integration"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Erlang/OTP 21 includes a new `:logger` module. Elixir v1.7 fully integrates wi"
"th the new `:logger` and leverages its metadata system. The `Logger.Translator"
"` mechanism has also been improved to export metadata, allowing custom Logger "
"backends to leverage information such as:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  * `:crash_reason` - a two-element tuple with the throw/error/exit reason as "
"the first argument and the stacktrace as the second"
msgstr ""

msgid "  * `:initial_call` - the initial call that started the process"
msgstr ""

msgid "  * `:registered_name` - the process' registered name as an atom"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We recommend Elixir libraries that previously hooked into Erlang's `:error_log"
"ger` to hook into `Logger` instead, in order to support all current and future"
" Erlang/OTP versions."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Logger compile-time purging"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Previously, Logger macros such as `debug`, `info`, and so on would always eval"
"uate their arguments, even when nothing would be logged. From Elixir v1.7 the "
"arguments are only evaluated when the message is logged."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Logger configuration system also accepts a new option called `:compile_tim"
"e_purge_matching` that allows you to remove log calls with specific compile-ti"
"me metadata. For example, to remove all logger calls from application `:foo` w"
"ith level lower than `:info`, as well as remove all logger calls from `Bar.foo"
"/3`, you can use the following configuration:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"config :logger,\n"
"  compile_time_purge_matching: [\n"
"    [application: :foo, level_lower_than: :info],\n"
"    [module: Bar, function: \"foo/3\"]\n"
"  ]\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "## ExUnit improvements"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"[ExUnit](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/) is Elixir's unit testing library. ExUnit"
" has always leveraged Elixir macros to provide excellent error reports when a "
"failure happens. For example, the following code:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"assert \"fox jumps over the lazy dog\" == \"brown fox jumps over the dog\"\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "will fail with the following report:"
msgstr ""

msgid "![ExUnit Diff](/images/contents/exunit-diff.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `assert` macro is able to look at the code, extract the current file, the "
"line, extract the operands and show a diff between the data structures alongsi"
"de the stacktrace when the assertion fails."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, sometimes we need to write assertions such as `assert some_function(e"
"xpr1, var2)`. When such assertion fails, we usually have to re-run the tests, "
"now debugging or printing the values of `expr1` and `var2`. In Elixir v1.7, wh"
"en a \"bare\" assertion fails, we will print the value of each argument individu"
"ally. For a simple example such as `assert some_vars(1 + 2, 3 + 4)`, we get th"
"is report:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"![ExUnit Bare Asssertion Diff](/images/contents/exunit-bare-assertion-diff.png"
")"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We have also [added coloring and diffing to doctests](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_un"
"it/ExUnit.DocTest.html#content)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While ExUnit is our test framework, Mix is our build tool. Developers typicall"
"y run their tests by calling `mix test`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On the `mix test` side of things, there is a new `--failed` flag that runs all"
" tests that failed the last time they ran. Finally, coverage reports generated"
" with `mix test --cover` include a summary out of the box:"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  * We have already highlighted some of the improvements in the ExDoc tool. An"
"other improvement worth mentioning is the syntax highlighting is now done in E"
"lixir itself, via the [Makeup](https://github.com/tmbb/makeup) library. This g"
