msgid "The first part of the project focuses on generating data from types, so we know how to generate function arguments. The missing piece is **validating** that a given term *belongs to* a given type. For example, in the snippet above, we want to be able to check if a term is a `boolean()`. Once we're able to do this, automatic spec validation will be straightforward: it will be a matter of generating random arguments for the given function, calling the function with those arguments, and asserting that the returned value belongs to the return type defined in the spec."

msgid "This kind of property-based testing doesn't test for *correctness*. In the snippet above, `has_key?/2` could be implemented to ignore arguments always return `false` and the automatic spec validation would pass since `false` is always a boolean. However, this is a kind of **smoke testing** useful for discovering inconsistencies in the arguments and return values of functions."

msgid "This project's goal is Tensorflex, an Elixir machine learning framework similar to [Keras for Python][keras]. Keras uses Tensorflow as a backend for doing all the machine learning. Tensorflex will use Using Native Implemented Functions (NIFs) and the Tensorflow C API as a backend to provide a low-level API. This low-level API will then be used to write a Keras-like framework in the form of a high-level API. This will allow Elixir developers to write expedient and efficient machine learning code in Elixir."

The task we aim to add to Elixir will focus on two main features: better user experience (in particular, better error messages and formatting) and the ability to analyze projects incrementally."

The benchmarking process will be controlled through a configuration file that will specify the benchmark scripts to run."
