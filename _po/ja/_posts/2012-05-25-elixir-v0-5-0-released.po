"I have started working in Elixir at the beginning of 2011. Around April that y"
"ear, I had released the version v0.3.0 that was stable enough for me to start "
"using in my own projects. However, after using it in a couple projects quickly"
" reviewed that I was not happy with some of the design decisions taken early o"
"n."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At that time, Elixir attempted to be a considerable departure from Erlang and "
"that revealed very fast to a bad design decision because, in order to use any "
"Erlang module, we first would have to provide an Elixir wrapper for it. Any ne"
"w function or module in new Erlang releases would have to be wrapped first in "
"Elixir, which means we would always play catch up with Erlang."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After not feeling productive enough with that Elixir version, I have decided t"
"o take a break from Elixir to study old, new and emerging languages. The chall"
"enge was to not re-invent Erlang as a language, but how to provide the product"
"ivity and flexibility I expect from Elixir while staying a 100% compatible wit"
"h Erlang."

"It was around October 2011, during a short stay in San Francisco, that I came "
"up with what would be [the foundation of Elixir's current version](https://git"
"hub.com/josevalim/lego-lang) with the help of Yehuda Katz. Development of the "
"new Elixir version started a few days before 2012 and continued steady when th"
"e new year came in."

"Around February of that year, feeling confident enough about the direction the"
" language was moving (and initial benchmarks I had made at that point), I have"
" pitched Elixir to [my company, Plataformatec](http://plataformatec.com.br/), "
"and they have accepted to sponsor Elixir. With their help, Elixir developed ev"
"en faster and that's what we are going to take a look next."

"One of the goals we have set was to have a good website and documentation befo"

"With v0.5.0 finally out, we are committing to a stable syntax and a basic stan"

"There are still many, many things to do! In the next months, we will continue "

"We will also work on better integration and documentation on building Erlang s"
"ystems. Erlang ships with the [Open Telecom Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org"
"/wiki/Open_Telecom_Platform) which provides many tools to build distributed ap"
"plications. In v0.5.0, all these tools are already available but we want to ma"
"ke the build process even simpler."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In parallel, we will improve our [documentation generation tool](https://githu"
"b.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc) and [build tool](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elix"
"ir/tree/master/lib/mix) which will likely be merged into core when they are so"
"lid enough."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, we will continue improving the Standard Library. Although Elixir's go"
"al is to rely on Erlang the most as possible, we also want to provide a small "
"Standard Library which makes better use of Elixir semantics. For the next week"
"s, we will focus on improving the IO and File manipulation modules. New data t"
"ypes may also appear, for example, ranges come to my mind."
