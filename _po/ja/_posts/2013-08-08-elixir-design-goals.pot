msgid "During the last year, we have spoken at many conferences spreading the word about Elixir. We [usually started with introducing the Erlang VM](https://vimeo.com/53221562), then went on to talk about Elixir goals, saving some time at the end to do a live demo, showing some goodies like exchanging information between remote nodes and even hot code swapping."

msgid "Elixir is meant to be compatible with the Erlang VM and the existing ecosystem. When we talk about Erlang, we can break it into three parts:"
msgstr ""

msgid "* A functional programming language, called Erlang\n"
"* A set of design principles, called OTP\n"
"* The Erlang Virtual Machine, referred to as EVM or BEAM"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2013-08-08-elixir-design-goals.markdown:21
msgid "Elixir runs in the same virtual machine and is compatible with OTP. Not only that, all the tools and libraries available in the Erlang ecosystem are also available in Elixir, simply because there is no conversion cost from calling Erlang from Elixir and vice-versa."

msgid "All Elixir code is executed inside light-weight processes (actors), each with its own state, that exchange messages between each other. The Erlang VM multiplexes those processes onto many cores, making it trivial to run code concurrently."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2013-08-08-elixir-design-goals.markdown:27
msgid "In fact if you compile any Elixir code, including the Elixir source, you will see all cores on your machine being used out of the box. With [technologies like Parallella](http://www.parallella.org/board/) becoming more accessible and affordable, it is hard to ignore the power you can get out of the Erlang VM."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2013-08-08-elixir-design-goals.markdown:29
msgid "Finally, the Erlang VM was designed to build systems that run forever, self-heal and scale. Joe Armstrong, one of Erlang's creators, has recently given an excellent talk [about the design decisions behind OTP and the VM](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/self-heal-scalable-system)."

msgid "> Now we need to go meta. We should now think of a language design as being a pattern for language designs. A tool for making more tools of the same kind. [...] A language design can no longer be a thing. It must be a pattern, a pattern for growth. A pattern for growing a pattern, for defining the patterns that programmers can use for their real work and main goals."

msgid "Productivity is, in general, a hard goal to measure. A language productive for creating desktop applications may not be productive for mathematical computing. Productivity depends directly on the field in which you intend to use the language, the available tools in the ecosystem and how easy it is to create and extend those tools."

msgid "For this reason, we have opted for a small language core. For example, while some languages have `if`, `case`, `try` and so on as language keywords, each with its own rules in the parser, **in Elixir they are just macros**. This allows us to implement most of Elixir in Elixir and also allows developers to extend the language using the same tools we used to build the language itself, often extending the language to the specific domains they are working on."

msgid "Macros are also the base construct for meta-programming in Elixir: the ability to write code that generates code. Meta-programming allows developers to easily get rid of boilerplate and create powerful tools. A common example mentioned in talks is how our test framework uses macros for expressiveness. Let's see an example:"

msgid "Next we define a test case and we do an assertion with the `assert` macro. Simply calling `assert` would be a bad practice in many languages as it would provide a poor error report. In such languages, functions/methods like `assertEqual` or `assert_equal` would be the recommended way of performing such assertion."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2013-08-08-elixir-design-goals.markdown:77

msgid "Although syntax is usually one of the first topics that comes up when Elixir is being discussed, it was never a goal to simply provide a different syntax. Since we wanted to provide a macro system, we knew that the macro system would only be sane if we could represent Elixir syntax in terms of Elixir's own data structures in a straight-forward fashion. With this goal in mind, we set out to design the first Elixir version, which looked like this:"

To this, we slowly added new syntax, making some common patterns more elegant while keeping the same underlying data representation. We soon added infix notation for operators:"
