"Elixir v1.1 supports both Erlang 17 and Erlang 18. This is, however, the last "
"release supporting Erlang 17, so upgrading to Erlang 18 is advised. Elixir v1."

"On the standard library side, about 40 new functions have been added to Elixir"
" public APIs. For example, [`Enum`](/docs/v1.1/elixir/Enum.html) got [`dedup/1"
