msgid "While [Programming Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir) was being announced, we have been working on Elixir v0.9.0 which is finally out. This release contains new features, important performance optimizations and bug fixes."

#: ../../../_posts/2013-05-23-elixir-v0-9-0-released.markdown:11
msgid "Elixir v0.9.0 also removes support for Erlang R15 and earlier versions. In case you still need to run Elixir software on R15, we have also released Elixir v0.8.3, which contains many of the enhancements in v0.9.0. Check the [CHANGELOG for more details for both releases](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/v0.9.0/CHANGELOG.md)."

msgid "We have spent some time improving compilation time. The particular scenario we have worked on was the definition of records:"

msgid "As a project grows, it is recommended to break it apart into smaller, isolated applications and bundle them together. The issue so far was that Elixir did not provide good support for working with many applications at once, and compiling and managing those applications became rather a tedious work."

msgid "It asked the `Enum.Iterator` protocol for instructions on how to iterate the list `[1, 2, 3]`. This iteration happened by retrieving each item in the list, one by one, until there were no items left."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2013-05-23-elixir-v0-9-0-released.markdown:64
msgid "This approach posed many problems:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2013-05-23-elixir-v0-9-0-released.markdown:66
msgid "* Iterators are very hard to compose;\n"
"* Iterators contain state. You need to know, at each moment, what is the next element you have to iterate next. We use functions and their bindings to pass the iteration state around;\n"
"* Iterators have the \"dangling open resource\" problem. Consider that you want to iterate a file with `Enum.map/2` as above. If any step during the iteration fails, there is no easy way to notify the resource being iterated  (in this case, the opened file) that iteration failed, so we can't close the file automatically, leaving it to the user."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2013-05-23-elixir-v0-9-0-released.markdown:70
msgid "Reducers solve all of those problems by using a more functional approach. Instead of asking a list to spill its elements out one by one and then working on each element, we now generate a recipe of computations and pass it down to the list which applies those computations on itself."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2013-05-23-elixir-v0-9-0-released.markdown:72
msgid "Here is how we implement the `Enumerable` protocol for lists:"

msgid "This approach solves all the problems above:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2013-05-23-elixir-v0-9-0-released.markdown:112
msgid "* Reducers are composable (notice how we have implemented map on top of reduce by composing functions);\n"
"* Reducers are self-contained: there is no need keep state around, which also solves the \"dangling open resource\" problem. The data type now knows exactly when the iteration starts and when it finishes;\n"
"* Reducers do not dictate how a type should be enumerated. This means types like `Range` and `HashDict` can provide a much faster implementation for Reducers;\n"
"* Furthermore, the end result is a cleaner implementation of most of `Enum` functions (the [reducers pull request](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/1102) removes over 500LOC) and better performance!"

msgid "Reducers also opens up room for lazy and parallel enumeration, as [the Clojure community has already proven](http://clojure.com/blog/2012/05/08/reducers-a-library-and-model-for-collection-processing.html) and something we are looking forward to explore on upcoming releases."

msgid "* Our CLI now supports `--hidden` and `--cookie` flags which are useful for distributed modes;\n"
"* Our test framework, ExUnit, is now able to capture all the communication that happens with a registed IO device, like `:stdio` and `:stderr`, via [`ExUnit.CaptureIO`](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/ExUnit.CaptureIO.html). This is very useful for testing how your software reacts to some inputs and what it prints to the terminal;\n"
"* `IEx` now allows files to be imported into the shell with `import_file` and also loads `~/.iex` on startup for custom configuration;\n"
"* The `String`, `Enum` and `Dict` modules got more convenience functions that goes from checking unicode character validity to taking values out of a dictionary;\n"
"* And many, many more!"
