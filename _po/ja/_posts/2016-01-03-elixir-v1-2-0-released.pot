msgid "v1.2 brings enhancements, bug fixes, performance improvements and more into Elixir. Elixir v1.2 relies on many features in Erlang 18, requiring at least Erlang 18+. Upgrading to Erlang 18 is therefore necessary before upgrading Elixir."

msgid "To celebrate this release and the new year, we have also reviewed both the [Getting Started](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html) and [Mix & OTP](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html) guides, bringing it up to date and exploring new functionalities added since Elixir v1.0."

#: ../../../_posts/2016-01-03-elixir-v1-2-0-released.markdown:17
msgid "  * Maps can now scale from dozens to millions of keys. Therefore, usage of the modules `Dict` and `HashDict` is now discouraged and will be deprecated in future releases, instead use `Map`. Similarly, `Set` and `HashSet` will be deprecated in favor of `MapSet`\n"
"  * Compilation times are ~15% faster on average due to improvements in both the Elixir and Erlang compilers and by using maps more extensively in the compilation stack\n"
"  * Dialyzer now emits less false negative warnings thanks to new annotations available in the Erlang compiler"

msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2016-01-03-elixir-v1-2-0-released.markdown:86
msgid "We have also improved both the parser and compiler to be more aware of language constructs, emitting warnings on common pitfalls like when piping to expressions without parentheses or when defining unsafe variables. Such improvements will point developers to the more idiomatic way of writing Elixir code early on."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2016-01-03-elixir-v1-2-0-released.markdown:88
msgid "Elixir v1.2 also introduces the `i/1` helper in IEx, which allows developers to retrieve information about any data type. This will help newcomers explore the language values while providing experienced developers with crucial information about the value they are introspecting. For example, giving a PID to `i/1` will show if it has a registered name, linked processes and more. Giving it a module, like `i(String)`, shows compile-time information and others."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2016-01-03-elixir-v1-2-0-released.markdown:96
msgid "One of such efforts resulted in \"Umbrella Projects\", which allows developers to build multiple applications side-by-side, but still run and test them in isolation when desired. Because each application contains its own configuration, supervision tree and initialization cycle, this gives developers the proper mechanisms to break monolithic applications apart without introducing the complexity of managing multiple, different repositories."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2016-01-03-elixir-v1-2-0-released.markdown:98
msgid "Up to this release, umbrella applications shared mostly dependencies, which meant each application still had their own build directory and their own compilation cycle. Elixir v1.2 allows developers to also share both build and configuration files. This change allows teams to drastically reduce compilation times in umbrella projects by adding the following configuration to each umbrella app's `mix.exs` file:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2016-01-03-elixir-v1-2-0-released.markdown:105
msgid "Umbrella applications generated with Elixir v1.2 will by default include this configuration. The downside of this approach is that applications are a bit less isolated, since configuration is now shared across all projects, although developers can revert back to the previous behaviour by simply removing the flags above."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2016-01-03-elixir-v1-2-0-released.markdown:107
msgid "Finally, Mix will now consolidate protocols by default as we are now able to consolidate in parallel and cache the consolidation results, providing the best performance across all environments without affecting compilation times."

msgid "## Rebar 3 support"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../_posts/2016-01-03-elixir-v1-2-0-released.markdown:113
msgid "With Rebar 3 gaining more adoption in the Erlang community, Mix is now able to fetch and compile Rebar 3 dependencies. This feature is currently experimental and therefore opt-in: if you have a Rebar 3 dependency, you can ask Mix to use Rebar 3 to compile it by passing the `manager: :rebar3` option. Once configured, Mix will prompt you to install Rebar 3 if it is not yet available."
