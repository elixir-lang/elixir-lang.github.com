msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you haven't yet installed Elixir, visit our [installation page](/install.ht"
"ml). Once you are done, you can run `elixir --version` to get the current Elix"
"ir version."

msgid "## Interactive mode"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you install Elixir, you will have three new executables: `iex`, `elixir` "
"and `elixirc`. If you compiled Elixir from source or are using a packaged vers"
"ion, you can find these inside the `bin` directory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For now, let's start by running `iex` (or `iex.bat` if you are on Windows) whi"
"ch stands for Interactive Elixir. In interactive mode, we can type any Elixir "
"expression and get its result. Let's warm up with some basic expressions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Open up `iex` and type the following expressions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```iex\n"
"Erlang/OTP 19 [erts-8.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [async-threads:10] [hipe]"
" [kernel-poll:false] [dtrace]"

"Interactive Elixir (1.4.0) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)\n"
"iex(1)> 40 + 2\n"
"42\n"
"iex(2)> \"hello\" <> \" world\"\n"
"\"hello world\"\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Please note that some details like version numbers may differ a bit in your se"
"ssion; that's not important. From now on `iex` sessions will be stripped down "
"to focus on the code. To exit `iex` press `Ctrl+C` twice."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It seems we are ready to go! We will use the interactive shell quite a lot in "
"the next chapters to get a bit more familiar with the language constructs and "
"basic types, starting in the next chapter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"> Note: if you are on Windows, you can also try `iex.bat --werl` which may pro"
"vide a better experience depending on which console you are using."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"> Note: if you want to find and execute a given script in PATH so it will be l"
"oaded in `iex` use: `iex -S SCRIPTNAME`.  Later you'll learn about [Mix](/gett"
"ing-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html), Elixir's build tool, and how yo"
"u can compile and load entire applications with `iex -S mix run`. See [Supervi"
"sor and application](/getting-started/mix-otp/supervisor-and-application.html)"
" for more details."

msgid "## Running scripts"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After getting familiar with the basics of the language you may want to try wri"
"ting simple programs. This can be accomplished by putting the following Elixir"
" code into a file:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"IO.puts \"Hello world from Elixir\"\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "Save it as `simple.exs` and execute it with `elixir`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```console\n"
"$ elixir simple.exs\n"
"Hello world from Elixir\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Later on we will learn how to compile Elixir code (in [Chapter 8](/getting-sta"
"rted/modules-and-functions.html)) and how to use the Mix build tool (in the [M"
"ix & OTP guide](/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html)). For now, "
"let's move on to [Chapter 2](/getting-started/basic-types.html)."

msgid "## Asking questions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When going through this getting started guide, it is common to have questions;"
" after all, that is part of the learning process! There are many places you co"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  * [#elixir-lang on freenode IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/elixir-lang)\n"
"  * [Elixir on Slack](https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com/)\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "When asking questions, remember these two tips:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  * Instead of asking \"how to do X in Elixir\", ask \"how to solve Y in Elixir\"."
" In other words, don't ask how to implement a particular solution, instead des"
"cribe the problem at hand. Stating the problem gives more context and less bia"
"s for a correct answer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  * In case things are not working as expected, please include as much informa"
"tion as you can in your report, for example: your Elixir version, the code sni"
"ppet and the error message alongside the error stacktrace. Use sites like [Gis"
"t](https://gist.github.com/) to paste this information."
