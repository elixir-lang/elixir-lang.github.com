msgid "Processes and links play an important role when building fault-tolerant systems. Elixir processes are isolated and don't share anything by default. Therefore, a failure in a process will never crash or corrupt the state of another process. Links, however, allow processes to establish a relationship in a case of failures. We often link our processes to supervisors which will detect when a process dies and start a new process in its place."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../getting-started/processes.markdown:135

The `loop/1` function then waits for messages and performs the appropriate action for each message. In the case of a `:get` message, it sends a message back to the caller and calls `loop/1` again, to wait for a new message. While the `:put` message actually invokes `loop/1` with a new version of the map, with the given `key` and `value` stored."
