msgid "Many functions in the standard library follow the pattern of having a counterpart that raises an exception instead of returning tuples to match against. The convention is to create a function (`foo`) which returns `{:ok, result}` or `{:error, reason}` tuples and another function (`foo!`, same name but with a trailing `!`) that takes the same arguments as `foo` but which raises an exception if there's an error. `foo!` should return the result (not wrapped in a tuple) if everything goes fine. The [`File` module](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html) is a good example of this convention."
