msgid "This guide aims to introduce the meta-programming techniques available in Elixir. The ability to represent an Elixir program by its own data structures is at the heart of meta-programming. This chapter starts by exploring those structures and the associated `quote` and `unquote` constructs, so we can take a look at macros in the next chapter and finally build our own domain specific language."
