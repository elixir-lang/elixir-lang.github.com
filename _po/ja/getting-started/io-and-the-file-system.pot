For example, `File.rm/1` can be used to remove files, `File.mkdir/1` to create directories, `File.mkdir_p/1` to create directories and all their parent chain. There are even `File.cp_r/2` and `File.rm_rf/1` to respectively copy and remove files and directories recursively (i.e., copying and removing the contents of the directories too)."

Of all IO devices, there is one that is special to each process: the **group leader**."

msgid "However, using lists in IO operations requires some attention. A list may represent either a bunch of bytes or a bunch of characters and which one to use depends on the encoding of the IO device. If the file is opened without encoding, the file is expected to be in raw mode, and the functions in the `IO` module starting with `bin*` must be used. Those functions expect an `iodata` as an argument; i.e., they expect a list of integers representing bytes and binaries to be given."
