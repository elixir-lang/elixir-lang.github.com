msgid "The Unicode standard assigns code points to many of the characters we know. For example, the letter `a` has code point `97` while the letter `ł` has code point `322`. When writing the string `\"hełło\"` to disk, we need to convert this code point to bytes. If we adopted a rule that said one byte represents one code point, we wouldn't be able to write `\"hełło\"`, because it uses the code point `322` for `ł`, and one byte can only represent a number from `0` to `255`. But of course, given you can actually read `\"hełło\"` on your screen, it must be represented *somehow*. That's where encodings come in."
