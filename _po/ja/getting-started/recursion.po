msgid "## Loops through recursion"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Due to immutability, loops in Elixir (as in any functional programming languag"
"e) are written differently from imperative languages. For example, in an imper"
"ative language like C, one would write:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```c\n"
"for(i = 0; i < sizeof(array); i++) {\n"
"  array[i] = array[i] * 2;\n"
"}\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the example above, we are mutating both the array and the variable `i`. Mut"
"ating is not possible in Elixir. Instead, functional languages rely on recursi"
"on: a function is called recursively until a condition is reached that stops t"
"he recursive action from continuing. No data is mutated in this process. Consi"
"der the example below that prints a string an arbitrary number of times:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"defmodule Recursion do\n"
"  def print_multiple_times(msg, n) when n <= 1 do\n"
"    IO.puts msg\n"
"  end"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  def print_multiple_times(msg, n) do\n"

"Recursion.print_multiple_times(\"Hello!\", 3)\n"
"# Hello!\n"

msgid ""
"Similar to `case`, a function may have many clauses. A particular clause is ex"
"ecuted when the arguments passed to the function match the clause's argument p"
"atterns and its guard evaluates to `true`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When `print_multiple_times/2` is initially called in the example above, the ar"
"gument `n` is equal to `3`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first clause has a guard which says \"use this definition if and only if `n"
"` is less than or equal to `1`\". Since this is not the case, Elixir proceeds t"
"o the next clause's definition."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second definition matches the pattern and has no guard so it will be execu"
"ted. It first prints our `msg` and then calls itself passing `n - 1` (`2`) as "
"the second argument."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Our `msg` is printed and `print_multiple_times/2` is called again, this time w"
"ith the second argument set to `1`.\n"
"Because `n` is now set to `1`, the guard in our first definition of `print_mul"
"tiple_times/2` evaluates to true, and we execute this particular definition. T"
"he `msg` is printed, and there is nothing left to execute."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We defined `print_multiple_times/2` so that, no matter what number is passed a"
"s the second argument, it either triggers our first definition (known as a _ba"
"se case_) or it triggers our second definition, which will ensure that we get "
"exactly one step closer to our base case."

msgid "Let's now see how we can use the power of recursion to sum a list of numbers:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"defmodule Math do\n"
"  def sum_list([head | tail], accumulator) do\n"
"    sum_list(tail, head + accumulator)\n"
"  end"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  def sum_list([], accumulator) do\n"

"  end\n"
"end"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"IO.puts Math.sum_list([1, 2, 3], 0) #=> 6\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We invoke `sum_list` with the list `[1, 2, 3]` and the initial value `0` as ar"
"guments. We will try each clause until we find one that matches according to t"
"he pattern matching rules. In this case, the list `[1, 2, 3]` matches against "
"`[head | tail]` which binds `head` to `1` and `tail` to `[2, 3]`; `accumulator"
"` is set to `0`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then, we add the head of the list to the accumulator `head + accumulator` and "
"call `sum_list` again, recursively, passing the tail of the list as its first "
"argument. The tail will once again match `[head | tail]` until the list is emp"
"ty, as seen below:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"sum_list [1, 2, 3], 0\n"
"sum_list [2, 3], 1\n"
"sum_list [3], 3\n"
"sum_list [], 6\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the list is empty, it will match the final clause which returns the final"
" result of `6`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The process of taking a list and _reducing_ it down to one value is known as a"
" _reduce algorithm_ and is central to functional programming."
msgstr ""

msgid "What if we instead want to double all of the values in our list?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgid ""
"Here we have used recursion to traverse a list, doubling each element and retu"
"rning a new list. The process of taking a list and _mapping_ over it is known "
"as a _map algorithm_."

"Recursion and [tail call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call) optimizatio"

"The [`Enum` module](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html), which we're going to"
" see in the next chapter, already provides many conveniences for working with "
"lists. For instance, the examples above could be written as:"
