"A string is a UTF-8 encoded binary. In order to understand exactly what we mea"

msgid ""
"The Unicode standard assigns code points to many of the characters we know. Fo"
"r example, the letter `a` has code point `97` while the letter `ł` has code po"
"int `322`. When writing the string `\"hełło\"` to disk, we need to convert this "
"code point to bytes. If we adopted a rule that said one byte represents one co"
"de point, we wouldn't be able to write `\"hełło\"`, because it uses the code poi"
"nt `322` for `ł`, and one byte can only represent a number from `0` to `255`. "
"But of course, given you can actually read `\"hełło\"` on your screen, it must b"
"e represented *somehow*. That's where encodings come in."

msgid ""
"When representing code points in bytes, we need to encode them somehow. Elixir"

"n a way to represent certain code points, as specified by the UTF-8 encoding."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since we have characters like `ł` assigned to the code point `322`, we actuall"

msgstr ""

"In practice, char lists are used mostly when interfacing with Erlang, in parti"
