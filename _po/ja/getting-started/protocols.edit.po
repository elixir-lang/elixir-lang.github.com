#: ../../../getting-started/protocols.markdown:12
msgid "In Elixir, we have two idioms for checking how many items there are in a data structure: `length` and `size`. `length` means the information must be computed. For example, `length(list)` needs to traverse the whole list to calculate its length. On the other hand, `tuple_size(tuple)` and `byte_size(binary)` do not depend on the tuple and binary size as the size information is precomputed in the data structure."

#: ../../../getting-started/protocols.markdown:14

msgstr ""

#: ../../../getting-started/protocols.markdown:127
msgid "However, should we be fine with the implementation for `Any`, in order to use such implementation we would need to tell our struct to explicitly derive the `Size` protocol:"

msgid "### Fallback to `Any`"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../getting-started/protocols.markdown:140
msgid "Another alternative to `@derive` is to explicitly tell the protocol to fallback to `Any` when an implementation cannot be found. This can be achieved by setting `@fallback_to_any` to `true` in the protocol definition:"
msgstr ""

"defprotocol Size do\n"

"```"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../getting-started/protocols.markdown:149
msgid "As we said in the previous section, the implementation of `Size` for `Any` is not one that can apply to any data type. That's one of the reasons why `@fallback_to_any` is an opt-in behaviour. For the majority of protocols, raising an error when a protocol is not implemented is the proper behaviour. That said, assuming we have implemented `Any` as in the previous section:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../getting-started/protocols.markdown:157
