msgstr ""

#: ../../../getting-started/debugging.markdown:14
msgid "What makes `IO.inspect(item, opts \\\\ [])` really useful in debugging is that it returns the `item` argument passed to it without affecting the behavior of the original code. Let's see an example."

If accepted, we will be able to access all variables, as well as imports and aliases from the code, directly From IEx. While pry is running, the code execution stops, until `continue` is called. Remember you can always run `iex` in the context of a project with `iex -S mix TASK`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../getting-started/debugging.markdown:84
msgid "Unfortunately, similar to `IO.inspect/2`, `IEx.pry/0` also requires us to change the code we intend to debug. Luckily IEx also provides a [`break!/2`](https://hexdocs.pm/iex/IEx.html#break!/2) function which allows you set and manage breakpoints on any Elixir code without modifying its source:"
