msgid "## Running tests"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mix also generated the appropriate structure for running our project tests. Mi"
"x projects usually follow the convention of having a `<filename>_test.exs` fil"
"e in the `test` directory for each file in the `lib` directory. For this reaso"

"end\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "It is important to note a couple things:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"1. the test file is an Elixir script file (`.exs`). This is convenient because"
" we don't need to compile test files before running them;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"2. we define a test module named `KVTest`, use [`ExUnit.Case`](https://hexdocs"
".pm/ex_unit/ExUnit.Case.html) to inject the testing API and define a simple te"
"st using the `test/2` macro;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mix also generated a file named `test/test_helper.exs` which is responsible fo"
"r setting up the test framework:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"ExUnit.start()\n"

msgid "    Randomized with seed 540224"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Notice that by running `mix test`, Mix has compiled the source files and gener"
"ated the application manifest once again. This happens because Mix supports mu"
"ltiple environments, which we will explore in the next section."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Furthermore, you can see that ExUnit prints a dot for each successful test and"
" automatically randomizes tests too. Let's make the test fail on purpose and s"
"ee what happens."

"th the test case, the code that failed and the values for the left side and ri"
"ght side (rhs) of the `==` operator."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the second line of the failure, right below the test name, there is the loc"
"ation where the test was defined. If you copy the test location in full, inclu"
"ding the file and line number, and append it to `mix test`, Mix will load and "
"run just that particular test:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```bash\n"
"$ mix test test/kv_test.exs:5\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This shortcut will be extremely useful as we build our project, allowing us to"
" quickly iterate by running a single test."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, the stacktrace relates to the failure itself, giving information abou"
"t the test and often the place the failure was generated from within the sourc"
"e files."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Environments"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mix supports the concept of \"environments\". They allow a developer to customiz"
"e compilation and other options for specific scenarios. By default, Mix unders"
"tands three environments:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"* `:dev` - the one in which Mix tasks (like `compile`) run by default\n"
"* `:test` - used by `mix test`\n"
"* `:prod` - the one you will use to run your project in production"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The environment applies only to the current project. As we will see later on, "
"any dependency you add to your project will by default run in the `:prod` envi"
"ronment."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Customization per environment can be done by accessing [the `Mix.env` function"
"](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.html#env/1) in your `mix.exs` file, which returns"
" the current environment as an atom. That's what we have used in the `:start_p"
"ermanent` options:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"def project do\n"
"  [...,\n"
"   start_permanent: Mix.env == :prod,\n"
"   ...]\n"
"end\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When true, the `:start_permanent` option starts your application in permanent "
"mode, which means the Erlang VM will crash if your application's supervision t"
"ree shuts down. Notice we don't want this behaviour in dev and test because it"
" is useful to keep the VM instance running in those environments for troublesh"
"ooting purposes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mix will default to the `:dev` environment, except for the `test` task that wi"
"ll default to the `:test` environment. The environment can be changed via the "
"`MIX_ENV` environment variable:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```bash\n"
"$ MIX_ENV=prod mix compile\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "Or on Windows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```batch\n"
"> set \"MIX_ENV=prod\" && mix compile\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"> Mix is a build tool and, as such, it is not always expected to be available "
"in production, especially if your team uses explicit build steps. Therefore, i"
"t is recommended to access `Mix.env` only in configuration files and inside `m"
"ix.exs`, never in your application code (`lib`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Exploring"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is much more to Mix, and we will continue to explore it as we build our "
"project. A [general overview is available on the Mix documentation](https://he"
"xdocs.pm/mix/)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that you can always invoke the help task to list all available ta"
"sks:"
