While a routing table as simple as the one above might reasonably be shared between all nodes, passing on the routing request in this way makes it much simpler to break the routing table into smaller pieces as our application grows. Perhaps at some point, `foo@computer-name` will only be responsible for routing bucket requests, and the buckets it handles will be dispatched to different nodes. In this way, `bar@computer-name` does not need to know anything about this change."

First of all, you need to ensure all machines have a `~/.erlang.cookie` file with exactly the same value. Second, you need to guarantee [epmd](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/epmd.html) is running on a port that is not blocked (you can run `epmd -d` for debug info). Third, if you want to learn more about distribution in general, we recommend [this great Distribunomicon chapter from Learn You Some Erlang](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/distribunomicon)."

A consistent hashing algorithm helps reduce the amount of data that needs to be migrated when new nodes to store buckets are added to your infrastructure."
