msgstr ""

msgid ""

"concurrent read operations."
msgstr ""

"The changes we have performed above have broken our tests because the registry"

"ations such as `lookup/2` require the name to be given as argument, instead of"

msgid ""
"Developing in Elixir does not make your code free of race conditions. However,"
" Elixir's abstractions where nothing is shared by default make it easier to sp"
"ot a race condition's root cause."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"What is happening in our tests is that there is a delay in between an operatio"
"n and the time we can observe this change in the ETS table. Here is what we we"
"re expecting to happen:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"1. We invoke `KV.Registry.create(registry, \"shopping\")`\n"
"2. The registry creates the bucket and updates the cache table\n"
"3. We access the information from the table with `KV.Registry.lookup(registry,"
" \"shopping\")`\n"
"4. The command above returns `{:ok, bucket}`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, since `KV.Registry.create/2` is a cast operation, the command will re"
"turn before we actually write to the table! In other words, this is happening:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"1. We invoke `KV.Registry.create(registry, \"shopping\")`\n"
"2. We access the information from the table with `KV.Registry.lookup(registry,"
" \"shopping\")`\n"
"3. The command above returns `:error`\n"
"4. The registry creates the bucket and updates the cache table"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To fix the failure we need to make `KV.Registry.create/2` synchronous by using"
" `call/2` rather than `cast/2`. This will guarantee that the client will only "
"continue after changes have been made to the table. Let's change the function "
"and its callback as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"def create(server, name) do\n"
"  GenServer.call(server, {:create, name})\n"
"end"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"def handle_call({:create, name}, _from, {names, refs}) do\n"
"  case lookup(names, name) do\n"

"    :error ->\n"
"      {:ok, pid} = KV.BucketSupervisor.start_bucket()\n"

"      {:reply, pid, {names, refs}}\n"
"  end\n"
"end\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We changed the callback from `handle_cast/2` to `handle_call/3` and changed it"
" to reply with the pid of the created bucket. Generally speaking, Elixir devel"
"opers prefer to use `call/2` instead of `cast/2` as it also provides back-pres"
"sure - you block until you get a reply. Using `cast/2` when not necessary can "
"also be considered a premature optimization."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's run the tests once again. This time though, we will pass the `--trace` o"
"ption:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```bash\n"
"$ mix test --trace\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `--trace` option is useful when your tests are deadlocking or there are ra"
"ce conditions, as it runs all tests synchronously (`async: true` has no effect"
") and shows detailed information about each test. This time we should be down "
"to one or two intermittent failures:"

"Unfortunately this time we cannot simply change `handle_info/2`, the operation"
" responsible for cleaning the ETS table, to a synchronous operation. Instead w"
"e need to find a way to guarantee the registry has processed the `:DOWN` notif"
"ication sent when the bucket crashed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An easy way to do so is by sending a synchronous request to the registry: beca"
"use messages are processed in order, if the registry replies to a request sent"
" after the `Agent.stop` call, it means that the `:DOWN` message has been proce"
