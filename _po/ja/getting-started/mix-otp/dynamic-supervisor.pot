msgid "Every time you add a new child to a supervisor, it is important to evaluate if the supervisor strategy is correct as well as the order of child processes. In this case, we are using `:one_for_one` and the `KV.Registry` is started before `KV.BucketSupervisor`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../../getting-started/mix-otp/dynamic-supervisor.markdown:127
msgid "One flaw that shows up right away is the ordering issue. Since `KV.Registry` invokes `KV.BucketSupervisor`, then the `KV.BucketSupervisor` must be started before `KV.Registry`. Otherwise, it may happen that the registry attempts to reach the bucket supervisor before it has started."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../../getting-started/mix-otp/dynamic-supervisor.markdown:129
msgid "The second flaw is related to the supervision strategy. If `KV.Registry` dies, all information linking `KV.Bucket` names to bucket processes is lost. Therefore the `KV.BucketSupervisor` and all children must terminate too - otherwise we will have orphan processes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../../getting-started/mix-otp/dynamic-supervisor.markdown:131
msgid "In light of this observation, we should consider moving to another supervision strategy. The two other candidates are `:one_for_all` and `:rest_for_one`. A supervisor using the `:rest_for_one` will kill and restart child processes which were started *after* the crashed child. In this case, we would want `KV.BucketSupervisor` to terminate if `KV.Registry` terminates. This would require the bucket supervisor to be placed after the registry. Which violates the ordering constraints we have established two paragraphs above."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../../getting-started/mix-otp/dynamic-supervisor.markdown:133
msgid "So our last option is to go all in and pick the `:one_for_all` strategy: the supervisor will kill and restart all of its children processes whenever any one of them dies. This is a completely reasonable approach for our application, since the registry can't work without the bucket supervisor, and the bucket supervisor should terminate without the registry. Let's reimplement `init/1` in `KV.Supervisor` to encode those properties:"

Although multiple registries may start buckets on the shared bucket supervisor, those buckets and registries are isolated from each other.
