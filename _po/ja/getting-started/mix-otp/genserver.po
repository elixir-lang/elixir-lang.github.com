msgid "## `call`, `cast` or `info`?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So far we have used three callbacks: `handle_call/3`, `handle_cast/2` and `han"
"dle_info/2`. Here is what we should consider when deciding when to use each:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"1. `handle_call/3` must be used for synchronous requests. This should be the d"
"efault choice as waiting for the server reply is a useful backpressure mechani"
"sm."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"2. `handle_cast/2` must be used for asynchronous requests, when you don't care"
" about a reply. A cast does not even guarantee the server has received the mes"
"sage and, for this reason, should be used sparingly. For example, the `create/"
"2` function we have defined in this chapter should have used `call/2`. We have"
" used `cast/2` for didactic purposes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"3. `handle_info/2` must be used for all other messages a server may receive th"
"at are not sent via `GenServer.call/2` or `GenServer.cast/2`, including regula"
"r messages sent with `send/2`. The monitoring `:DOWN` messages are such an exa"
"mple of this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since any message, including the ones sent via `send/2`, go to `handle_info/2`"
", there is a chance unexpected messages will arrive to the server. Therefore, "
"if we don't define the catch-all clause, those messages could cause our regist"
"ry to crash, because no clause would match. We don't need to worry about such "
"cases for `handle_call/3` and `handle_cast/2` though. Calls and casts are only"
" done via the `GenServer` API, so an unknown message is quite likely a develop"
"er mistake."

msgid ""
"We have previously learned about links in the [Process chapter](/getting-start"

"n should we use monitors and when should we use links?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Links are bi-directional. If you link two processes and one of them crashes, t"
