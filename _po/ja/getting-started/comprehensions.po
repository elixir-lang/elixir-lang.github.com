"In Elixir, it is common to loop over an Enumerable, often filtering out some r"
"esults and mapping values into another list. Comprehensions are syntactic suga"
"r for such constructs: they group those common tasks into the `for` special fo"
"rm."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, we can map a list of integers into their squared values:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```iex\n"
"iex> for n <- [1, 2, 3, 4], do: n * n\n"
"[1, 4, 9, 16]\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "A comprehension is made of three parts: generators, filters and collectables."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Generators and filters"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the expression above, `n <- [1, 2, 3, 4]` is the **generator**. It is liter"
"ally generating values to be used in the comprehension. Any enumerable can be "
"passed in the right-hand side of the generator expression:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```iex\n"
"iex> for n <- 1..4, do: n * n\n"
"[1, 4, 9, 16]\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generator expressions also support pattern matching on their left-hand side; a"
"ll non-matching patterns are *ignored*. Imagine that, instead of a range, we h"
"ave a keyword list where the key is the atom `:good` or `:bad` and we only wan"
"t to compute the square of the `:good` values:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```iex\n"
"iex> values = [good: 1, good: 2, bad: 3, good: 4]\n"
"iex> for {:good, n} <- values, do: n * n\n"
"[1, 4, 16]\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively to pattern matching, filters can be used to select some particul"
"ar elements. For example, we can select the multiples of 3 and discard all oth"
"ers:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```iex\n"
"iex> multiple_of_3? = fn(n) -> rem(n, 3) == 0 end\n"
"iex> for n <- 0..5, multiple_of_3?.(n), do: n * n\n"
"[0, 9]\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Comprehensions discard all elements for which the filter expression returns `f"
"alse` or `nil`; all other values are selected."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Comprehensions generally provide a much more concise representation than using"
" the equivalent functions from the `Enum` and `Stream` modules. Furthermore, c"
"omprehensions also allow multiple generators and filters to be given. Here is "
"an example that receives a list of directories and gets the size of each file "
"in those directories:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"dirs = ['/home/mikey', '/home/james']\n"
"for dir  <- dirs,\n"
"    file <- File.ls!(dir),\n"
"    path = Path.join(dir, file),\n"
"    File.regular?(path) do\n"
"  File.stat!(path).size\n"
"end\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Multiple generators can also be used to calculate the cartesian product of two"
" lists:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```iex\n"
"iex> for i <- [:a, :b, :c], j <- [1, 2], do:  {i, j}\n"
"[a: 1, a: 2, b: 1, b: 2, c: 1, c: 2]\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A more advanced example of multiple generators and filters is Pythagorean trip"
"les. A Pythagorean triple is a set of positive integers such that `a*a + b*b ="
" c*c`, let's write a comprehension in a file named `triple.exs`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"defmodule Triple do\n"
"  def pythagorean(n) when n > 0 do\n"
"    for a <- 1..n,\n"
"        b <- 1..n,\n"
"        c <- 1..n,\n"
"        a + b + c <= n,\n"
"        a*a + b*b == c*c,\n"
"        do: {a, b, c}\n"
"  end\n"
"end\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now on terminal:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```bash\n"
"iex triple.exs\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```iex\n"
"iex> Triple.pythagorean(5)\n"
"[]\n"
"iex> Triple.pythagorean(12)\n"
"[{3, 4, 5}, {4, 3, 5}]\n"
"iex> Triple.pythagorean(48)\n"
"[{3, 4, 5}, {4, 3, 5}, {5, 12, 13}, {6, 8, 10}, {8, 6, 10}, {8, 15, 17},\n"
" {9, 12, 15}, {12, 5, 13}, {12, 9, 15}, {12, 16, 20}, {15, 8, 17}, {16, 12, 20"
"}]\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The code above is quite expensive when the range of search is a large number. "
"Additionally, since the tuple `{b, a, c}` represents the same Pythagorean trip"
"le as `{a, b, c}`, our function yields duplicate triples. We can optimize the "
"comprehension and eliminate the duplicate results by referencing the variables"
" from previous generators in the following ones, for example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"defmodule Triple do\n"
"  def pythagorean(n) when n > 0 do\n"
"    for a <- 1..n-2,\n"
"        b <- a+1..n-1,\n"
"        c <- b+1..n,\n"
"        a + b + c <= n,\n"
"        a*a + b*b == c*c,\n"
"        do: {a, b, c}\n"
"  end\n"
"end\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, keep in mind that variable assignments inside the comprehension, be i"
"t in generators, filters or inside the block, are not reflected outside of the"
" comprehension."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Bitstring generators"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Bitstring generators are also supported and are very useful when you need to c"
"omprehend over bitstring streams. The example below receives a list of pixels "
"from a binary with their respective red, green and blue values and converts th"
"em into tuples of three elements each:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```iex\n"
"iex> pixels = <<213, 45, 132, 64, 76, 32, 76, 0, 0, 234, 32, 15>>\n"
"iex> for <<r::8, g::8, b::8 <- pixels>>, do: {r, g, b}\n"
"[{213, 45, 132}, {64, 76, 32}, {76, 0, 0}, {234, 32, 15}]\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A bitstring generator can be mixed with \"regular\" enumerable generators, and s"
"upports filters as well."
msgstr ""

msgid "## The `:into` option"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the examples above, all the comprehensions returned lists as their result. "
"However, the result of a comprehension can be inserted into different data str"
"uctures by passing the `:into` option to the comprehension."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, a bitstring generator can be used with the `:into` option in orde"
"r to easily remove all spaces in a string:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```iex\n"
"iex> for <<c <- \" hello world \">>, c != ?\\s, into: \"\", do: <<c>>\n"
"\"helloworld\"\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sets, maps and other dictionaries can also be given to the `:into` option. In "
"general, `:into` accepts any structure that implements the `Collectable` proto"
"col."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A common use case of `:into` can be transforming values in a map, without touc"
"hing the keys:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```iex\n"
"iex> for {key, val} <- %{\"a\" => 1, \"b\" => 2}, into: %{}, do: {key, val * val}\n"
"%{\"a\" => 1, \"b\" => 4}\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's make another example using streams. Since the `IO` module provides strea"
"ms (that are both `Enumerable`s and `Collectable`s), an echo terminal that ech"
"oes back the upcased version of whatever is typed can be implemented using com"
"prehensions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```iex\n"
"iex> stream = IO.stream(:stdio, :line)\n"
"iex> for line <- stream, into: stream do\n"
"...>   String.upcase(line) <> \"\n"
"\"\n"
"...> end\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now type any string into the terminal and you will see that the same value wil"
"l be printed in upper-case. Unfortunately, this example also got your IEx shel"
"l stuck in the comprehension, so you will need to hit `Ctrl+C` twice to get ou"
"t of it. :)"
