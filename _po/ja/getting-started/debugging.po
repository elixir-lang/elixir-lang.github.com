msgid "## IO.inspect/2"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"What makes `IO.inspect(item, opts \\\\ [])` really useful in debugging is that i"
"t returns the `item` argument passed to it without affecting the behavior of t"
"he original code. Let's see an example."

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"(1..10)\n"
"|> IO.inspect\n"
"|> Enum.map(fn x -> x * 2 end)\n"
"|> IO.inspect\n"
"|> Enum.sum\n"
"|> IO.inspect\n"

"As you can see `IO.inspect/2` makes it possible to \"spy\" on values almost anyw"
"here in your code without altering the result, making it very helpful inside o"
"f a pipeline like in the above case."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`IO.inspect/2` also provides the ability to decorate the output with a `label`"
" option. The label will be printed before the inspected `item`:"

msgid ""
"```elixir\n"
"[1, 2, 3]\n"
"|> IO.inspect(label: \"before\")\n"
"|> Enum.map(&(&1 * 2))\n"

"It is also very common to use `IO.inspect/2` with [`binding()`](https://hexdoc"
"s.pm/elixir/Kernel.html#binding/0), which returns all variable names and their"

"While `IO.inspect/2` is static, Elixir's interactive shell provides more dynam"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first one is with [`IEx.pry/0`](https://hexdocs.pm/iex/IEx.html#pry/0) whi"

"e pry is running, the code execution stops, until `continue` is called. Rememb"
"er you can always run `iex` in the context of a project with `iex -S mix TASK`"
"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unfortunately, similar to `IO.inspect/2`, `IEx.pry/0` also requires us to chan"
"ge the code we intend to debug. Luckily IEx also provides a [`break!/2`](https"
"://hexdocs.pm/iex/IEx.html#break!/2) function which allows you set and manage "
"breakpoints on any Elixir code without modifying its source:"
