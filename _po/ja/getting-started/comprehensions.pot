msgid "In Elixir, it is common to loop over an Enumerable, often filtering out some results and mapping values into another list. Comprehensions are syntactic sugar for such constructs: they group those common tasks into the `for` special form."

msgid "In the expression above, `n <- [1, 2, 3, 4]` is the **generator**. It is literally generating values to be used in the comprehension. Any enumerable can be passed on the right-hand side of the generator expression:"

msgid "Generator expressions also support pattern matching on their left-hand side; all non-matching patterns are *ignored*. Imagine that, instead of a range, we have a keyword list where the key is the atom `:good` or `:bad` and we only want to compute the square of the `:good` values:"

msgid "Comprehensions generally provide a much more concise representation than using the equivalent functions from the `Enum` and `Stream` modules. Furthermore, comprehensions also allow multiple generators and filters to be given. Here is an example that receives a list of directories and gets the size of each file in those directories:"
