This chapter will focus on ensuring that Elixir is installed and that you can successfully run Elixir's Interactive Shell, called IEx."

msgid "> Note: if you want to find and execute a given script in PATH so it will be loaded in `iex` use: `iex -S SCRIPTNAME`.  Later you'll learn about [Mix](/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html), Elixir's build tool, and how you can compile and load entire applications with `iex -S mix run`. See [Supervisor and application](/getting-started/mix-otp/supervisor-and-application.html) for more details."

#: ../../../getting-started/introduction.markdown:88
msgid "  * Instead of asking \"how to do X in Elixir\", ask \"how to solve Y in Elixir\". In other words, don't ask how to implement a particular solution, instead describe the problem at hand. Stating the problem gives more context and less bias for a correct answer."

#: ../../../getting-started/introduction.markdown:90
msgid "  * In case things are not working as expected, please include as much information as you can in your report, for example: your Elixir version, the code snippet and the error message alongside the error stacktrace. Use sites like [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) to paste this information."
