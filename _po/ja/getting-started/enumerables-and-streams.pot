msgid "The functions in the Enum module are limited to, as the name says, enumerating values in data structures. For specific operations, like inserting and updating particular elements, you may need to reach for modules specific to the data type. For example, if you want to insert an element at a given position in a list, you should use the `List.insert_at/3` function from [the `List` module](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/List.html), as it would make little sense to insert a value into, for example, a range."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../getting-started/enumerables-and-streams.markdown:34
msgid "We say the functions in the `Enum` module are polymorphic because they can work with diverse data types. In particular, the functions in the `Enum` module can work with any data type that implements [the `Enumerable` protocol](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enumerable.html). We are going to discuss Protocols in a later chapter; for now we are going to move on to a specific kind of enumerable called a stream."

msgid "The `|>` symbol used in the snippet above is the **pipe operator**: it takes the output from the expression on its left side and passes it as the first argument to the function call on its right side. It's similar to the Unix `|` operator.  Its purpose is to highlight the data being transformed by a series of functions. To see how it can make the code cleaner, have a look at the example above rewritten without using the `|>` operator:"
