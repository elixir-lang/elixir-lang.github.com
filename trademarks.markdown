This document outlines the policy for allowed usage of the "Elixir" word and the Elixir logo by other parties.

"Elixir" and the Elixir logo are registered trademarks of the Elixir Team. The Elixir Team believes in a decentralized approach to growing the community and the ecosystem, independent of the Elixir project and the Elixir Team.

Anyone can use the Elixir trademarks if that use of the trademark is nominative. The trademarks must not be used to disparage the project and its community, nor be used in any way to imply ownership, endorsement, or association with the Elixir project and the Elixir Team.

You must not visually combine the Elixir logo with any other images, or change the logo in any way other than ways required by printing restrictions. If you want to create your own visual identity in relation to Elixir, you might design or combine your mark on top of any "water drop silhouette", as seen in many community projects and initiatives. You must not combine or modify the Elixir logo.

## Nominative use

The "nominative use" (or "nominative fair use") is a legal doctrine that authorizes everyone (even commercial companies) to use or refer to the trademark of another if:

  * The product or service in question must be one not readily identifiable without use of the trademark.

  * Only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service.

  * The organization using the mark must do nothing that would, in conjunction with the mark, suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder.

## Examples of permitted use

All examples listed next must strictly adhere to the terms outlined in the previous sections:

  * Usage of the Elixir logo to say a technology is "powered by Elixir". Linking back to the Elixir website, if possible, is appreciated.

  * Usage of the Elixir logo to display it as a supported technology in a service or platform. For instance, you may say "we support Elixir" and list the Elixir logo, but you may not refer to yourself as "the Elixir platform" nor imply any form of endorsement or association with Elixir.

  * Usage of the Elixir logo in non-commercial community meetups, presentations, and courses when referring to the language and its ecosystem under nominative use.

  * Inclusion of the Elixir logo in icon libraries. Note users of the Elixir icon must still adhere to Elixir's trademark policies.

  * Usage of the Elixir word in book titles, conferences, and podcasts. You must not use the word in a way to imply uniqueness or endorsement from the Elixir team. "The Elixir book" and "The Elixir podcast" are not permitted, "Elixir in Action" and "Thinking Elixir" are.

## Examples of not permitted use

  * Usage of the Elixir logo in book covers, conferences, and podcasts.

  * Usage of the Elixir logo as the mark of third-party projects, even in combination with other marks.

  * Naming any company or product after Elixir, such as "The Elixir Hosting", "The Elixir Consultants", etc.

## Examples that require permission

  * Selling merchandise (stickers, t-shirts, mugs, etc).

You can request permission by emailing trademarks@elixir-lang.org.

## Disclaimer

Nothing in this page shall be interpreted to allow any third party to claim any association with the Elixir project and the Elixir Team, or to imply any approval or support by the Elixir project and the Elixir Team for any third party products, services, or events.
