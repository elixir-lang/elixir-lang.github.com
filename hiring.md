  * the [ElixirCompanies website](https://elixir-companies.com/en)
  * the ["Who is hiring" Hacker News monthly thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=whoishiring)
  * the [jobs channel in the Elixir Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T03EPRA2X/C060RDHPX)
  * the [#jobs channel in the Elixir Discord](https://discord.com/channels/269508806759809042/1016408077714608168/1016408077714608168)
  * the [Elixir Programming group on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6530248)
  * the [Elixir Radar newsletter](https://elixir-radar.com/post-your-job-listing-in-the-elixir-radar-for-free)
* Scanning Open Source contributions in the community. You can find the

* Consider making your company known to the community by attending/hosting
  gatherings (in person or remote), sponsoring/participating in a conference
  (presenting/sponsoring) and writing technical blog posts about how your
  company uses Elixir and its ecossystem.
