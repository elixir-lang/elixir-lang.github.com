      <p>Elixir is a programming language built on top of the Erlang VM. As Erlang, it is a functional language built to support distributed, fault-tolerant, non-stop applications with hot code swapping.</p>
      <p>Elixir is also dynamic typed but, differently from Erlang, it is also homoiconic, allowing meta-programming via macros. Elixir also supports polymorphism via protocols (similar to Clojure's), dynamic records and provides a reference mechanism.</p>
      <p>Finally, Elixir and Erlang share the same bytecode and data types. This means you can invoke Erlang code from Elixir (and vice-versa) without any conversion or performance hit. This allows a developer to mix the expressiveness of Elixir with the robustness and performance of Erlang.</p>
      <p>If you want to install Elixir or learn more about it, check our <a href="/getting_started/1.html">getting started guide</a>. We also have <a href="/docs">online documentation available</a> and a <a href="/crash-course.html">Crash Course for Erlang developers</a>.</p>
