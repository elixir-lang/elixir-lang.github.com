# Learning

{% include toc.html %}

Elixir's official documentation includes a [Getting Started guide](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/introduction.html) to learn more about Elixir's foundations. Later on, it explores how to build projects with [Mix and OTP](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/introduction-to-mix.html). Elixir also includes [extensive API documentation](/docs.html).

The Elixir Community has also produced plenty of resources to learn the language from different backgrounds and other perspectives. We list some of them below. We are sure you will find a resource that suits your pace and goals.

## Books

<h4 class="resource">Elixir in Action</h4>

<a class="cover" href="https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action-third-edition" title="Elixir in Action
– by Saša Jurić"><img src="/images/learning/elixir-in-action.jpg" alt="Elixir in Action cover" width="190" /></a>

Elixir in Action is a tutorial book that aims to bring developers new to Elixir and Erlang to the point where they can develop complex systems on their own. No knowledge about Elixir, Erlang, or functional programming is required, but it is assumed that a reader has a few years of production experience using mainstream OO languages, for example C#, Java, Python, or Ruby.

The book starts with a basic introduction to the Elixir language and functional programming idioms. The central part of the book deals with Erlang VM and OTP, discussing topics such as concurrent programming, fault-tolerance, and distributed systems. Finally, you'll learn how to package your code into components, create a standalone deployable release, and troubleshoot the running system. The theory is demonstrated through a simplistic example that is gradually expanded throughout the book into a fully standalone releasable system.

<h4 class="resource">Programming Elixir 1.6</h4>

<a class="cover" href="https://pragprog.com/titles/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6/" title="Programming Elixir 1.6: Functional |&gt; Concurrent |&gt; Pragmatic |&gt; Fun
– by Dave Thomas"><img src="/images/learning/programming-elixir-1-6.jpg" alt="Programming Elixir cover" width="190" /></a>

This book is the introduction to Elixir for experienced programmers, completely updated for Elixir 1.6 and beyond. Explore functional programming without the academic overtones (tell me about monads just one more time). Create concurrent applications, but get them right without all the locking and consistency headaches.

Meet Elixir, a modern, functional, concurrent language built on the rock-solid Erlang VM. Elixir's pragmatic syntax and built-in support for metaprogramming will make you productive and keep you interested for the long haul. Maybe the time is right for the Next Big Thing. Maybe it's Elixir.

## In-depth books

<h4 class="resource">Metaprogramming Elixir</h4>

<a class="cover" href="https://pragprog.com/titles/cmelixir/metaprogramming-elixir/" title="Metaprogramming Elixir: Write Less Code, Get More Done and Have Fun
– by Chris Mccord"><img src="/images/learning/metaprogramming-elixir.jpg" alt="Metaprogramming Elixir cover" width="190" /></a>

Write code that writes code with Elixir macros. Macros make metaprogramming possible and define the language itself. In this book, you'll learn how to use macros to extend the language with fast, maintainable code and share functionality in ways you never thought possible. You'll discover how to extend Elixir with your own first-class features, optimize performance, and create domain-specific languages.

<div class="clear"></div>

<h4 class="resource">Designing Elixir Systems with OTP</h4>

<a class="cover" href="https://pragprog.com/titles/jgotp/designing-elixir-systems-with-otp/" title="Designing Elixir Systems with OTP: Write Highly Scalable, Self-Healing Software with Layers
– by James Edward Gray, II and Bruce A. Tate"><img src="/images/learning/designing-elixir-systems.jpg" alt="Designing Elixir Systems with OTP cover" width="190" /></a>

You know how to code in Elixir; now learn to think in it. Learn to design libraries with intelligent layers that shape the right data structures, flow from one function into the next, and present the right APIs. Embrace the same OTP that's kept our telephone systems reliable and fast for over 30 years. Move beyond understanding the OTP functions to knowing what's happening under the hood, and why that matters. Using that knowledge, instinctively know how to design systems that deliver fast and resilient services to your users, all with an Elixir focus.

<div class="clear"></div>

<h4 class="resource">Concurrent Data Processing in Elixir</h4>

<a class="cover" href="https://pragprog.com/titles/sgdpelixir/concurrent-data-processing-in-elixir" title="Concurrent Data Processing in Elixir – by Svilen Gospodinov"><img src="/images/learning/concurrent-data-processing.jpg" alt="Concurrent Data Processing cover" width="190" /></a>

Learn different ways of writing concurrent code in Elixir and increase your application’s performance, without sacrificing scalability or fault-tolerance. Most projects benefit from running background tasks and processing data concurrently, but the world of OTP and various libraries can be challenging. Which Supervisor and what strategy to use? What about GenServer? Maybe you need back-pressure, but is GenStage, Flow, or Broadway a better choice? You will learn everything you need to know to answer these questions, start building highly concurrent applications in no time, and write code that’s not only fast, but also resilient to errors and easy to scale.

Pattern matching is a really powerful language feature. It is built in to almost every corner or Elixir. In order for you to even <em>read</em> Elixir code and follow along, you have to understand Pattern Matching.

Once you "get" pattern matching, it feels like a super power. Pattern Matching makes new patterns of coding possible. You start to unlearn some of the patterns you've used in other languages because now you can create even clearer and more elegant code than was possible before!

The course covers getting setup with Elixir, the data types, how to pattern match each of them, and more! An included TDD project helps you easily apply what you're learning.
