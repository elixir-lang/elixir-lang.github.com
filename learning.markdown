## Learn Elixir

<h4 class="resource">Programming Elixir 1.2</h4>

<a class="cover" href="https://pragprog.com/book/elixir12/programming-elixir-1-2" title="Programming Elixir 1.2: Functional |&gt; Concurrent |&gt; Pragmatic |&gt; Fun
– by Dave Thomas"><img src="/images/learning/programming-elixir.jpg" alt="Programming Elixir cover" width="190" /></a>

You want to explore functional programming, but are put off by the academic feel (tell me about monads just one more time). You know you need concurrent applications, but also know these are almost impossible to get right. Meet Elixir, a functional, concurrent language built on the rock-solid Erlang VM.

Elixir’s pragmatic syntax and built-in support for metaprogramming will make you productive and keep you interested for the long haul. And Programming Elixir is the introduction to Elixir for experienced programmers, written by the same person that wrote the first English books on Ruby and then Rails. Starting with pattern matching, it takes you all the way through concurrency, agents, supervisors, and ends with OTP applications. Along the way, you'll learn tools, techniques, and good practices for creating tomorrow's applications.

<h4 class="resource">Elixir in Action</h4>

<a class="cover" href="http://manning.com/juric/" title="Elixir in Action
– by Saša Jurić"><img src="/images/learning/elixir-in-action.jpg" alt="Elixir in Action cover" width="190" /></a>

Elixir in Action is a tutorial book that aims to bring developers new to Elixir and Erlang to the point where they can develop complex systems on their own. No knowledge about Elixir, Erlang, or functional programming is required, but it is assumed that a reader has a few years of production experience using mainstream OO languages, for example C#, Java, Python, or Ruby.

The book starts with a basic introduction to the Elixir language and functional programming idioms. The central part of the book deals with Erlang VM and OTP, discussing topics such as concurrent programming, fault-tolerance, and distributed systems. Finally, you'll learn how to package your code into components, create a standalone deployable release, and troubleshoot the running system. The theory is demonstrated through a simplistic example that is gradually expanded throughout the book into a fully standalone releasable system.

<h4 class="resource">Introducing Elixir</h4>

<a class="cover" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030584.do" title="Introducing Elixir: Getting Started in Functional Programming
– by Simon St. Laurent, J. David Eisenberg"><img src="/images/learning/introducing-elixir.jpg" alt="Introducing Elixir cover" width="190" /></a>

Elixir is an excellent language if you want to learn about functional programming, and with this hands-on introduction, you’ll discover just how powerful and fun Elixir can be. This language combines the robust functional programming of Erlang with a syntax similar to Ruby, and includes powerful features for metaprogramming.

This book shows you how to write simple Elixir programs by teaching one skill at a time. Once you pick up pattern matching, process-oriented programming, and other concepts, you’ll understand why Elixir makes it easier to build concurrent and resilient programs that scale up and down with ease.

<h4 class="resource">Elixir Cookbook</h4>

<a class="cover" href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/elixir-cookbook" title="Elixir Cookbook
– by Paulo A Pereira"><img src="/images/learning/elixir-cookbook.jpg" alt="Elixir Cookbook cover" width="190" /></a>

This book is a set of recipes grouped by topic that acts as a reference to get ideas from or to quickly search for a solution to a problem. You will begin by launching an IEx session and using it to test some ideas. Next, you will perform various operations like loading and compiling modules, inspecting your system, generating a supervised app, and so on. Furthermore, you will be introduced to immutability, working with data structures, performing pattern matching, and using stream modules to generate infinite data sequences. You will learn about everything from joining strings to determining the word frequency in text. With respect to modules and functions, you will also discover how to load code from other modules and use guards and pattern matching in functions.

<h4 class="resource">Take Off With Elixir</h4>

<a class="cover" href="http://redfour.io" title="Take Off With Elixir"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3532678/red4_cover.jpg" alt="Red:4" width="190" /></a>

Red:4 is a fictional aerospace startup that needs your help! Through a book, a video, or both you can learn Elixir the fun way by immersing yourself in an on-the-job style set of problems. For instance, you will set up a project to calculate escape velocity for each of the planets in our solar system, learning pattern matching and language basics along the way. You'll move on to orbital mechanics while learning how to debug and refactor your code for clarity and meaning. You'll learn list basics and data storage techniques as you build a solar flare tracking system. Finally, you'll dive into OTP using Ecto and PostgreSQL - all in an effort to overwhelm our internal systems with the power of Elixir!
