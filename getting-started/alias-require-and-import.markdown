# {{ page.title }}

In order to facilitate software reuse, Elixir provides three directives. As we are going to see below, they are called directives because they have **lexical scope**.

{% include toc.html %}

## `alias`

`alias` allows you to set up aliases for any given module name. Imagine our `Math` module uses a special list implementation for doing math specific operations:

```elixir
defmodule Math do
  alias Math.List, as: List
end
```

From now on, any reference to `List` will automatically expand to `Math.List`. In case one wants to access the original `List`, it can be done by prefixing the module name with `Elixir.`:

```elixir
List.flatten             #=> uses Math.List.flatten
Elixir.List.flatten      #=> uses List.flatten
Elixir.Math.List.flatten #=> uses Math.List.flatten
```

> Note: All modules defined in Elixir are defined inside a main Elixir namespace. However, for convenience, you can omit "Elixir." when referencing them.

Aliases are frequently used to define shortcuts. In fact, calling `alias` without an `:as` option sets the alias automatically to the last part of the module name, for example:

```elixir
alias Math.List
```

Is the same as:

```elixir
alias Math.List, as: List
```

Note that `alias` is **lexically scoped**, which allows you to set aliases inside specific functions:

```elixir
defmodule Math do
  def plus(a, b) do
    alias Math.List
    # ...
  end

  def minus(a, b) do
    # ...
  end
end
```

In the example above, since we are invoking `alias` inside the function `plus/2`, the alias will just be valid inside the function `plus/2`. `minus/2` won't be affected at all.

## `require`

Elixir provides macros as a mechanism for meta-programming (writing code that generates code).

Macros are chunks of code that are executed and expanded at compilation time. This means, in order to use a macro, we need to guarantee its module and implementation are available during compilation. This is done with the `require` directive:

```iex
iex> Integer.is_odd(3)
** (CompileError) iex:1: you must require Integer before invoking the macro Integer.is_odd/1
iex> require Integer
nil
iex> Integer.is_odd(3)
true
```

In Elixir, `Integer.is_odd/1` is defined as a macro so that it can be used as a guard. This means that, in order to invoke `Integer.is_odd/1`, we need to first require the `Integer` module.

In general a module does not need to be required before usage, except if we want to use the macros available in that module. An attempt to call a macro that was not loaded will raise an error. Note that like the `alias` directive, `require` is also lexically scoped. We will talk more about macros in a later chapter.

## `import`

We use `import` whenever we want to easily access functions or macros from other modules without using the fully-qualified name. For instance, if we want to use the `duplicate/2` function from the `List` module several times, we can simply import it:

```iex
iex> import List, only: [duplicate: 2]
nil
iex> duplicate :ok, 3
[:ok, :ok, :ok]
```

In this case, we are importing only the function `duplicate` (with arity 2) from `List`. Although `:only` is optional, its usage is recommended in order to avoid importing all the functions of a given module inside the namespace. `:except` could also be given as an option in order to import everything in a module *except* a list of functions.

`import` also supports `:macros` and `:functions` to be given to `:only`. For example, to import all macros, one could write:

```elixir
import Integer, only: :macros
```

Or to import all functions, you could write:

```elixir
import Integer, only: :functions
```

Note that `import` is **lexically scoped** too. This means that we can import specific macros or functions inside function definitions:

```elixir
defmodule Math do
  def some_function do
    import List, only: [duplicate: 2]
    duplicate(:ok, 10)
  end
end
```

In the example above, the imported `List.duplicate/2` is only visible within that specific function. `duplicate/2` won't be available in any other function in that module (or any other module for that matter).

Note that `import`ing a module automatically `require`s it.

## Aliases

At this point you may be wondering: what exactly an Elixir alias is and how is it represented?

An alias in Elixir is a capitalized identifier (like `String`, `Keyword`, etc) which is converted to an atom during compilation. For instance, the `String` alias translates by default to the atom `:"Elixir.String"`:

```iex
iex> is_atom(String)
true
iex> to_string(String)
"Elixir.String"
iex> :"Elixir.String" == String
true
```

By using the `alias/2` directive, we are simply changing what an alias translates to.

Aliases work as described because in the Erlang <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr> (and consequently Elixir) modules are represented by atoms. For example, that's the mechanism we use to call Erlang modules:

```iex
iex> :lists.flatten([1, [2], 3])
[1, 2, 3]
```

This is also the mechanism that allows us to dynamically call a given function in a module:

```iex
iex> mod = :lists
:lists
iex> mod.flatten([1, [2], 3])
[1, 2, 3]
```

We are simply calling the function `flatten` on the atom `:lists`.

## Nesting

Now that we have talked about aliases, we can talk about nesting and how it works in Elixir. Consider the following example:

```elixir
defmodule Foo do
  defmodule Bar do
  end
end
```

The example above will define two modules: `Foo` and `Foo.Bar`. The second can be accessed as `Bar` inside `Foo` as long as they are in the same lexical scope.

If later the `Bar` module is moved outside the `Foo` module definition, it will need to be referenced by its full name (`Foo.Bar`) or an alias will need to be set using the `alias` directive discussed above. The `Bar` module definition will change too. This code is equivalent to the example above:

```elixir
defmodule Foo.Bar do
end

defmodule Foo do
  alias Foo.Bar, as: Bar
end
```

The code above is exactly the same as:

```elixir
defmodule Elixir.Foo do
  defmodule Elixir.Foo.Bar do
  end
  alias Elixir.Foo.Bar, as: Bar
end
```

**Note**: in Elixir, you don't have to define the `Foo` module before being able to define the `Foo.Bar` module, as the language translates all module names to atoms anyway. You can define arbitrarily-nested modules without defining any module in the chain (e.g., `Foo.Bar.Baz` without defining `Foo` or `Foo.Bar` first).

As we will see in later chapters, aliases also play a crucial role in macros, to guarantee they are hygienic.

With this we are almost finishing our tour about Elixir modules. The last topic to cover is module attributes.
