There are a number of ways to debug code in Elixir. In this chapter we will cover some of the more common ways of doing so.

## IO.inspect/2

What makes `IO.inspect(item, opts \\ [])` really useful in debugging is that it returns the `item` argument passed to it without affecting the behavior of the original code. Let's see an example.

```elixir
(1..10)
|> IO.inspect
|> Enum.map(fn x -> x * 2 end)
|> IO.inspect
|> Enum.sum
|> IO.inspect
```

Prints:

```elixir
1..10
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
110
```

As you can see `IO.inspect/2` makes it possible to "spy" on values almost anywhere in your code without altering the result, making it very helpful inside of a pipeline like in the above case.

`IO.inspect/2` also provides the ability to decorate the output with a `label` option. The label will be printed before the inspected `item`:

```elixir
[1, 2, 3]
|> IO.inspect(label: "before")
|> Enum.map(&(&1 * 2))
|> IO.inspect(label: "after")
|> Enum.sum
```

Prints:

```elixir
before: [1, 2, 3]
after: [2, 4, 6]
```

It is also very common to use `IO.inspect/2` with [`binding()`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.html#binding/0), which returns all variable names and their values:

```elixir
def some_fun(a, b, c) do
  IO.inspect binding()
  ...
end
```

When `some_fun/3` is invoked with `:foo`, `"bar"`, `:baz` it prints:

```elixir
[a: :foo, b: "bar", c: :baz]
```

Please see [IO.inspect/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/IO.html#inspect/2) to read more about other ways in which one could use this function. Also, in order to find a full list of other formatting options that one can use alongside `IO.inspect/2`, see [Inspect.Opts](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Inspect.Opts.html).

## `IEx.pry/0` and `IEx.break!/2`

While `IO.inspect/2` is static, Elixir's interactive shell provides more dynamic ways to interact with debugged code.

The first one is with [`IEx.pry/0`](https://hexdocs.pm/iex/IEx.html#pry/0) which we can use instead of `IO.inspect binding()`:

```elixir
def some_fun(a, b, c) do
  require IEx; IEx.pry
  ...
end
```

Once the code above is executed inside an `iex` session, IEx will ask if we want to pry into the current code. If accepted, we will be able to access all variables, as well as imports and aliases from the code, directly From IEx. While pry is running, the code execution stops, until `continue` is called. Remember you can always run `iex` in the context of a project with `iex -S mix TASK`.

Unfortunately, similar to `IO.inspect/2`, `IEx.pry/0` also requires us to change the code we intend to debug. Luckily IEx also provides a [`break!/2`](https://hexdocs.pm/iex/IEx.html#break!/2) function which allows you set and manage breakpoints on any Elixir code without modifying its source:

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/0h3po0AmTcBAorc5GBNU97nrs.js" id="asciicast-0h3po0AmTcBAorc5GBNU97nrs" async></script><noscript><p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/0h3po0AmTcBAorc5GBNU97nrs">See the example in asciinema</a></p></noscript>

Similar to `IEx.pry/0`, once a breakpoint is reached code execution stops until `continue` is invoked. However, note `break!/2` does not have access to aliases and imports from the debugged code as it works on the compiled artifact rather than on source.

## Debugger

For those who enjoy breakpoints but are rather interested in a visual debugger, Erlang/OTP ships with a graphical debugger conveniently named `:debugger`. Let's define a module:

```elixir
defmodule Example do
  def double_sum(x, y) do
    hard_work(x, y)
  end

  defp hard_work(x, y) do
    x = 2 * x
    y = 2 * y

    x + y
  end
end
```

> If the `debugger` does not start, here is what may have happened: some package managers default to installing a minimized Erlang without WX bindings for GUI support. In some package managers, you may be able to replace the headless Erlang with a more complete package (look for packages named `erlang` vs `erlang-nox` on Debian/Ubuntu/Arch). In others managers, you may need to install a separate `erlang-wx` (or similarly named) package.

Now we can start our debugger:

```iex
$ iex -S mix
iex(1)> :debugger.start()
{:ok, #PID<0.87.0>}
iex(2)> :int.ni(Example)
{:module, Example}
iex(3)> :int.break(Example, 3)
:ok
iex(4)> Example.double_sum(1,2)
```

When you start the debugger, a Graphical User Interface will open in your machine. We call `:int.ni(Example)` to prepare our module for debugging and then add a breakpoint to line 3 with `:int.break(Example, 3)`. After we call our function, we can see our process with break status in the debugger:

## Observer

For debugging complex systems, jumping at the code is not enough. It is necessary to have an understanding of the whole virtual machine, processes, applications, as well as set up tracing mechanisms. Luckily this can be achieved in Erlang with `:observer`. In your application:

```iex
$ iex -S mix
iex(1)> :observer.start()
```

> Similar to the `debugger` note above, your package manager may require a separate installation in order to run Observer.

The above will open another Graphical User Interface that provides many panes to fully understand and navigate the runtime and your project:

We explore the Observer in the context of an actual project [in the Dynamic Supervisor chapter of the Mix & OTP guide](/getting-started/mix-otp/dynamic-supervisor.html).

You can also [use Observer to introspect a remote node](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2016/05/tracing-and-observing-your-remote-node/). This is one of the debugging techniques [the Phoenix framework used to achieve 2 million connections on a single machine](https://phoenixframework.org/blog/the-road-to-2-million-websocket-connections).

Finally, remember you can also get a mini-overview of the runtime info by calling `runtime_info/0` directly in IEx.

## Other tools and community

We have just scratched the surface of what the Erlang VM has to offer, for example:

  * Alongside the observer application, Erlang also includes a `:crashdump_viewer` to view crash dumps
  * Integration with OS level tracers, such as [Linux Trace Toolkit,](http://erlang.org/doc/apps/runtime_tools/LTTng.html) [DTRACE,](http://erlang.org/doc/apps/runtime_tools/DTRACE.html) and [SystemTap](http://erlang.org/doc/apps/runtime_tools/SYSTEMTAP.html)
  * [Microstate accounting](http://erlang.org/doc/man/msacc.html) measures how much time the runtime spends in several low-level tasks in a short time interval
  * Mix ships with many tasks under the `profile` namespace, such as `cprof` and `fprof`
  * And more

The community has also created its own tools, often to aid in production, other times in development:

  * [wObserver](https://github.com/shinyscorpion/wObserver) observes production nodes through a web interface.
  * [visualixir](https://github.com/koudelka/visualixir) is a development-time process message visualizer.
  * [erlyberly](https://github.com/andytill/erlyberly) is a GUI for tracing during development.

There are probably many more to come too!
