In this chapter, we will show how the `=` operator in Elixir is actually a match operator and how to use it to pattern match inside data structures. Finally, we will learn about the pin operator `^` used to access previously bound values.

## The match operator

We have used the `=` operator a couple times to assign variables in Elixir:

```iex
iex> x = 1
1
iex> x
1
```

In Elixir, the `=` operator is actually called *the match operator*. Let's see why:

```iex
iex> 1 = x
1
iex> 2 = x
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: 1
```

Notice that `1 = x` is a valid expression, and it matched because both the left and right side are equal to 1. When the sides do not match, a `MatchError` is raised.

A variable can only be assigned on the left side of `=`:

```iex
iex> 1 = unknown
** (RuntimeError) undefined function: unknown/0
````

Since there is no variable `unknown` previously defined, Elixir imagined you were trying to call a function named `unknown/0`, but such a function does not exist.

## Pattern matching

The match operator is not only used to match against simple values, but it is also useful for destructuring more complex data types. For example, we can pattern match on tuples:

```iex
iex> {a, b, c} = {:hello, "world", 42}
{:hello, "world", 42}
iex> a
:hello
iex> b
"world"
```

A pattern match will error in the case the sides can't match. This is, for example, the case when the tuples have different sizes:

```iex
iex> {a, b, c} = {:hello, "world"}
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: {:hello, "world"}
```

And also when comparing different types:

```iex
iex> {a, b, c} = [:hello, "world", "!"]
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: [:hello, "world", "!"]
```

More interestingly, we can match on specific values. The example below asserts that the left side will only match the right side when the right side is a tuple that starts with the atom `:ok`:

```iex
iex> {:ok, result} = {:ok, 13}
{:ok, 13}
iex> result
13

iex> {:ok, result} = {:error, :oops}
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: {:error, :oops}
```

We can pattern match on lists:

```iex
iex> [a, b, c] = [1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3]
iex> a
1
```

A list also supports matching on its own head and tail:

```iex
iex> [head | tail] = [1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3]
iex> head
1
iex> tail
[2, 3]
```

Similar to the `hd/1` and `tl/1` functions, we can't match an empty list with a head and tail pattern:

```iex
iex> [h | t] = []
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: []
```

The `[head | tail]` format is not only used on pattern matching but also for prepending items to a list:

```iex
iex> list = [1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3]
iex> [0 | list]
[0, 1, 2, 3]
```

Pattern matching allows developers to easily destructure data types such as tuples and lists. As we will see in following chapters, it is one of the foundations of recursion in Elixir and applies to other types as well, like maps and binaries.

## The pin operator

Variables in Elixir can be rebound:

```iex
iex> x = 1
1
iex> x = 2
2
```

The pin operator `^` should be used when you want to pattern match against an existing variable's value rather than rebinding the variable:

```iex
iex> x = 1
1
iex> ^x = 2
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: 2
iex> {y, ^x} = {2, 1}
{2, 1}
iex> y
2
iex> {y, ^x} = {2, 2}
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: {2, 2}
```

Because we have assigned the value of 1 to the variable x, this last example could also have been written as:

```
iex> {y, 1} = {2, 2}
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: {2, 2}
```

If a variable is mentioned more than once in a pattern, all references should bind to the same pattern:

```iex
iex> {x, x} = {1, 1}
1
iex> {x, x} = {1, 2}
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: {1, 2}
```

In some cases, you don't care about a particular value in a pattern. It is a common practice to bind those values to the underscore, `_`. For example, if only the head of the list matters to us, we can assign the tail to underscore:

```iex
iex> [h | _] = [1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3]
iex> h
1
```

The variable `_` is special in that it can never be read from. Trying to read from it gives an unbound variable error:

```iex
iex> _
** (CompileError) iex:1: unbound variable _
```

Although pattern matching allows us to build powerful constructs, its usage is limited. For instance, you cannot make function calls on the left side of a match. The following example is invalid:

```iex
iex> length([1, [2], 3]) = 3
** (CompileError) iex:1: illegal pattern
```

This finishes our introduction to pattern matching. As we will see in the next chapter, pattern matching is very common in many language constructs.
