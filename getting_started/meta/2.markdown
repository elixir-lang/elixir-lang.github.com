Macros can be defined in Elixir using `defmacro/2`.

> For this chapter, we will be using files instead of running code samples in IEx. That's because the code samples will span multiple lines of code and typing them all in IEx can be counter-productive. You should be able to run the code samples by saving them into a `macros.exs` file and running it with `elixir macros.exs` or `iex macros.exs`.

## 2.1 Our first macro

In order to better understand how macros work, let's create a new module where we are going to implement `unless`, which does the opposite of `if`, as a macro and as a function:

```elixir
defmodule Unless do
  def fun_unless(clause, expression) do
    if(!clause, do: expression)
  end

  defmacro macro_unless(clause, expression) do
    quote do
      if(!unquote(clause), do: unquote(expression))
    end
  end
end
```

The function receives the arguments and pass them to `if`. However, the macro will receive quoted expressions, as we have learned in the previous chapter, inject them into the quote, finally returning another quoted expression.

Let's start `iex` with the module above:

    $ iex macros.exs

And play with those definitions:

```iex
iex> require Unless
iex> Unless.macro_unless true, IO.puts "this should never be printed"
nil
iex> Unless.fun_unless true, IO.puts "this should never be printed"
"this should never be printed"
nil
```

Note that in our macro implementation, the sentence was not printed, although it was printed in our function implementation. That's because the arguments to a function call are evaluated before calling the function. However macros do not evaluate the arguments, instead they receive the arguments as quoted expressions which are then transformed into other quoted expressions. In this case, we have rewritten our `unless` macro to become an `if` behind the scenes.

In other words, when invoked as:

```elixir
Unless.macro_unless true, IO.puts "this should never be printed"
```

Our `macro_unless` macro received the following:

```elixir
macro_unless(true, {{:., [], [IO, :puts], [], ["this should never be printed"]}})
```

And it then return a quoted expression as follows:

```elixir
{:if, [], [
  {:!, [], [true]},
  {{:., [], [IO, :puts], [], ["this should never be printed"]}}]}
```

We can actually verify this is the case by using `Macro.expand_once/2`:

```iex
iex> expr = quote do: Unless.macro_unless(true, IO.puts "this should never be printed")
iex> res  = Macro.expand_once(expr, __ENV__)
iex> IO.puts Macro.to_string(res)
if(!true) do
  IO.puts("this should never be printed")
end
:ok
```

`Macro.expand_once/2` receives a quoted expression and expands it according to the current environment. In this case, it expanded/invoked the `Unless.macro_unless/2` macro and returned its result. We then proceeded to convert the returned quoted expression to a string and print it (we will talk about `__ENV__` still in this chapter).

That's what macros are all about. They are about receiving quoted expressions and transforming them into something else. In fact, `unless/2` in Elixir is implemented as a macro:

```elixir
defmacro unless(clause, options) do
  quote do
    if(!unquote(clause), do: unquote(options))
  end
end
```

Not only `unless/2`, `defmacro/2`, `def/2`, `defprotocol/2` and many constructs used throughout this getting started guide are implemented in pure Elixir, often as a macros. This means that the constructs being used to build the language, can be used by developers to extend the language to the domains they are working on.

We can define any function and macro we want, including ones that override the built-in definitions provided by Elixir. The only exceptions are Elixir special forms which are not implemented in Elixir and therefore cannot be overridden, [the full list of special forms is available in `Kernel.SpecialForms`](/docs/stable/elixir/Kernel.SpecialForms.html).

## 2.2 Macros hygiene

Elixir macros have late resolution. This guarantees that a variable defined inside a quote won't conflict with a variable defined in the context where that macro is expanded. For example:

```elixir
defmodule Hygiene do
  defmacro no_interference do
    quote do: a = 1
  end
end

defmodule HygieneTest do
  def go do
    require Hygiene
    a = 13
    Hygiene.no_interference
    a
  end
end

HygieneTest.go
# => 13
```

In the example above, even if the macro injects `a = 1`, it does not affect the variable `a` defined by the `go` function. In case the macro wants to explicitly affect the context, it can use `var!`:

```elixir
defmodule Hygiene do
  defmacro interference do
    quote do: var!(a) = 1
  end
end

defmodule HygieneTest do
  def go do
    require Hygiene
    a = 13
    Hygiene.interference
    a
  end
end

HygieneTest.go
# => 1
```

Variables hygiene only works because Elixir annotates variables with their context. For example, a variable `x` defined at the line 3 of a module, would be represented as:

    {:x, [line: 3], nil}

However, a quoted variable is represented as:

```elixir
defmodule Sample do
  def quoted do
    quote do: x
  end
end

Sample.quoted #=> {:x, [line: 3], Sample}
```

Notice that the third element in the quoted variable is the atom `Sample`, instead of `nil`, which marks the variable as coming from the `Sample` module. Therefore, Elixir considers those two variables come from different contexts and handle them accordingly.

Elixir provides similar mechanisms for imports and aliases too. This guarantees macros will behave as specified by its source module rather than conflicting with the target module where the macro is expanded. Hygiene can be passed under specific situations by using macros like `var!/2` and `alias!/2`, although one must be careful when using those as they directly change the user environment.

## 2.3 The environment

When using `Macro.expand_once/2` earlier in this chapter, we have used the special form `__ENV__`.

`__ENV__` returns an instance of `Macro.Env` which contains useful information about the compilation environment. It contains useful information like the current module, file and line, all variables defined in the current scope, as well as imports, requires and so on.

Let's give it a try:

```iex
iex> __ENV__.module
nil
iex> __ENV__.file
"iex"
iex> __ENV__.requires
[IEx.Helpers, Kernel, Kernel.Typespec]
iex> require Integer
nil
iex> __ENV__.requires
[IEx.Helpers, Integer, Kernel, Kernel.Typespec]
```

Many of the functions in the `Macro` module expect an environment. You can read more about them in [the docs for the `Macro` module](/docs/stable/elixir/Macro.html) and learn more about the compilation environment with [`Macro.Env`](/docs/stable/elixir/Macro.Env.html).

## 2.4 Private macros

Elixir also supports private macros via `defmacrop`. As private functions, these macros are only available inside the module that defines them, and only at compilation time.

It is important that a macro is defined before its usage. Failing to define a macro before its invocation will raise an error at runtime, since the macro won't be expanded and will be translated to a function call:

```elixir
iex> defmodule Sample do
...>  def four, do: two + two
...>  defmacrop two, do: 2
...> end
** (CompileError) iex:2: function two/0 undefined
```

## 2.5 Write macros responsibly

Macros are a powerful construct and Elixir provides many mechanisms to ensure they are used responsibly:

* Macros are hygienic: by default, variables defined inside the macro are not going to affect the user code. Furthermore, functions calls and aliases available in the macro context are not going to leak into the user context;

* Macros are lexical: it is impossible to inject code or macros globally. Before using a macro, you need to explicitly `require` or `import` the module that defines the macro;

* Macros are explicit: it is impossible to run a macro without explicitly invoking it. For example, some languages allow developers to completely rewrite functions behind the scenes, often via parse transforms or via some reflection mechanisms. In Elixir, a macro must be explicitly invoked in the caller;

* Macros' language is clear: many languages provide syntax shortcuts for `quote` and `unquote`. In Elixir, we preferred to have those explicitly spelled out, in order to clearly delimit the boundaries of a macro definition;

Even if Elixir attempts its best to provide a safe environment, the major responsibility still falls on the developers. That's why the first rule of the macro club is **write macros responsibly**. Macros are harder to write than ordinary Elixir functions and it's considered to be bad style to use them when they're not necessary. Elixir already provides elegant mechanisms to write your every day code and macros should be saved as last resort.

With those lessons, we finish our introduction to macros. The next chapter is a brief discussion on DSLs, showing how we can mix macros and module attributes to annotate and extend modules and functions.
