# 1 Introduction

Welcome! In this tutorial we are going to show you how to get started with Elixir. We will start with how to install Elixir, how to use its interactive shell, and basic data types and operators. In later chapters, we are even going to discuss more advanced subjects such as macros, protocols and other features provided by Elixir.

Keep in mind that Elixir is still in development so if at any point you receive an error message and you are not sure how to proceed, [please let us know in the issues tracker](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/issues). Having explanative and consistent error messages is one of the many features we aim for Elixir.

## 1.1 Installation

The only prerequisite for Elixir is Erlang, version R15B or later. You can find the source code for [Erlang here](http://www.erlang.org/download.html) or use one of the [precompiled packages](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp).

For Windows developers, we recommend the precompiled package. Those on the UNIX platform can probably get Erlang installed via one of the many package management tools.

After Erlang is installed, you should be able to open up the command line (or command prompt) and check the Erlang version by typing `erl`. You will see some information as follows:

    Erlang R15B (erts-5.8.4) [source] [64-bit] [smp:2:2] [rq:2] [async-threads:0] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

Notice that depending on how you installed Erlang, it will not add Erlang binaries to your environment. Be sure to have Erlang binaries in your [PATH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable), otherwise Elixir won't work!

After Erlang is up and running, it is time to install Elixir. You can do that via Distributions, Precompiled package or Compiling from Source.

### 1.1.1 Distributions

Elixir is available in some distributions:

* Homebrew for Mac OS X: `brew install elixir`
* Fedora 17+ and Fedora Rawhide: `sudo yum -y install elixir`

If you don't use any of the distributions above, don't worry! We also provide a precompiled package!

### 1.1.2 Precompiled package

Elixir provides a package file with its compiled source for every release. You can grab the latest [in the downloads page](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/downloads) (make sure to download one of the versioned packages under the "Download packages" section and not the "Download as zip/tar.gz" buttons which will rather download Elixir's master branch).

After unzip-ing the package, you are ready to run the `elixir` and `iex` commands from the `bin` directory. It is recommended that you also add Elixir's `bin` path to your PATH environment variable to ease development. In a Unix system, that can be achieved with:

    export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/elixir/bin"

### 1.1.3 Compiling from source (Unix)

You can download and compile Elixir in few steps. You can get the [latest stable release here](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/tags), unpack it and then run `make` inside the unpacked directory. After that, you are ready to run the `elixir` and `iex` commands from the `bin` directory.

In case you are feeling a bit more adventurous, you can also compile from master:

    $ git clone https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir.git
    $ cd elixir
    $ make test

If the tests pass, you are ready to go. Otherwise, feel free to open an issue [in the issues tracker on Github](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir).

## 1.2 Interactive mode

When you install Elixir, you will have three new executables: `iex`, `elixir` and `elixirc`. If you compiled Elixir from source or you are using a packaged version, you can find these inside the `bin` directory.

For now, let's start by running `iex` which stands for Interactive Elixir. In interactive mode, we can type any Elixir expression and get its result straight away. Let's warm up with some basic arithmetic expressions:

    iex> 1 + 1
    2
    iex> 10 - 5
    5
    iex> 10 / 2
    5.0

Notice `10 / 2` returned a float `5.0` instead of an integer. This is expected. In Elixir the operator `/` always returns a float. In case you want to do integer division or get the division remainder, you can invoke the `div` and `rem` functions:

    iex> div(10, 2)
    5
    iex> div 10, 2
    5
    iex> rem 10, 3
    1

In the example above, we called two functions called `div` and `rem`. Notice that parentheses are not required in order to invoke a function. We are going to discuss more about it later. Let's move forward and see which other data types we have in Elixir:

## 1.3 Basic types

Some basic types are:

    iex> 1          # integer
    iex> 1.0        # float
    iex> :atom      # atom / symbol
    iex> {1,2,3}    # tuple
    iex> [1,2,3]    # list

Elixir also provides functions (note the dot between the variable and arguments when calling a function):

    # function
    iex> x = fn(a, b) -> a + b end
    #Fun<erl_eval.12.111823515>
    iex> x.(1, 2)
    3

And double-quoted strings:

    iex> "string"
    "string"

Strings in Elixir are UTF-8 binaries delimited by double quotes. A single-quoted string in Elixir is called a char list and is simply a list of characters:

    iex> 'string'
    'string'

There is also string interpolation:

	iex> name = "world"
	iex> "hello #{name}"
	"hello world"

We can use the `is_binary` and `is_list` helpers to detect if a given string is a binary (double-quoted) or a list (single-quoted):

    iex> is_binary "string"
    true
    iex> is_list "string"
    false

    iex> is_binary 'string'
    false
    iex> is_list 'string'
    true

Although they represent the same thing, double-quoted and single-quoted strings are different and best suited for different scenarios:

    iex> "string" == 'string'
    false

In most cases, developers should use double-quoted strings as their representation is more compact. We'll discuss this subject with more detail in the next chapter.

Elixir also provides `true` and `false` as booleans:

    iex> true
    true
    iex> is_boolean false
    true

Booleans are represented internally as atoms:

    iex> is_atom(true)
    true

Elixir also provides Port, References and PIDs as data types (usually used in process communication) but they are out of the scope of a getting started tutorial. For now, let's take a look at the basic operators in Elixir before we move on to the next chapter.

## 1.4 Operators

As we saw earlier, Elixir provides `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` as arithmetic operators.

Elixir also provides `++` and `--` to manipulate lists:

    iex> [1,2,3] ++ [4,5,6]
    [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    iex> [1,2,3] -- [2]
    [1,3]

Since single-quoted strings are lists, we can also use `++` and `--` as operators to manipulate them:

    iex> 'some' ++ ' example'
    'some example'
    iex> 'some' -- 'oe'
    'sm'

Notice that `++` and `--` cannot be used to manipulate double quoted strings, as they are binaries. That said, string concatenation is done via `<>`:

    iex> "foo" <> "bar"
    "foobar"

Elixir also provides three boolean operators: `or`, `and` and `not`. These operators are strict in the sense they expect a boolean (true or false) as their first argument:

    iex> true and true
    true
    iex> false or is_atom(:example)
    true

Giving a non-boolean will raise an exception:

    iex> 1 and true
    ** (ArgumentError) argument error

`or` and `and` are short-circuit operators. They just execute the right side in case the left side is not enough to determine the result:

    iex> false and error("This error will never be raised")
    false

    iex> true or error("This error will never be raised")
    true

> Note: If you are an Erlang developer, `and` and `or` in Elixir actually map to the `andalso` and `orelse` operators in Erlang.

Elixir also provides `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`, `<=`, `>=`, `<` and `>` as comparison operators:

    iex> 1 == 1
    true
    iex> 1 != 2
    true
    iex> 1 < 2
    true

The difference between `==` and `===` is that the latter is more strict when comparing integers and floats:

    iex> 1 == 1.0
    true
    iex> 1 === 1.0
    false

In Elixir, we can compare two different data types:

    iex> 1 < :atom
    true

The reason we can compare different data types is for pragmatism. Sorting algorithms don't need to worry about different data types in order to sort. The overall sorting order is defined below:

    number < atom < reference < functions < port < pid < tuple < list < bit string

You actually don't need to memorize this ordering, but it is important just to know an order exists.

Well, that is it for the introduction. In the next chapter, we are going to discuss some basic functions, data types conversions and a bit of control-flow.
