In early chapters, we have learned about maps:

```iex
iex> map = %{a: 1, b: 2}
%{a: 1, b: 2}
iex> map[:a]
1
iex> %{map | a: 3}
%{a: 3, b: 2}
```

Structs are extensions on top of maps that bring default values, compile-time guarantees and polymorphism into Elixir.

To define a struct, we just need to call `defstruct/1` inside a module:

```iex
iex> defmodule User do
...>   defstruct name: "jose", age: 27
...> end
{:module, User,
 <<70, 79, 82, ...>>, {:__struct__, 0}}
```

We can now create "instances" of this struct by using the `%User{}` syntax:

```iex
iex> %User{}
%User{name: "jose", age: 27}
iex> %User{name: "eric"}
%User{name: "eric", age: 27}
iex> is_map(%User{})
true
```

Structs give compile-time guarantees that the provided fields exist in the struct:

```iex
iex> %User{oops: :field}
** (CompileError) iex:3: unknown key :oops for struct User
```

When discussing maps, we demonstrated how we can access and update existing fields of a map. The same applies to structs:

```iex
iex> jose = %User{}
%User{name: "jose", age: 27}
iex> jose.name
"jose"
iex> eric = %{jose | name: "eric"}
%User{name: "eric", age: 27}
iex> %{user | oops: :field}
** (ArgumentError) argument error
```

By using the update syntax, the VM is aware no new keys will be added to the map/struct, leading the different maps created a long the way to share their structure. In the example above, both `jose` and `eric` share the same structure.

A struct is just a bare map with default fields. Notice we say it is a bare map because none of the protocols implemented for maps are available for structs. For example, you can't enumerate nor access a struct:

```iex
iex> user = %User{}
%User{name: "jose", age: 27}
iex> user[:name]
** (Protocol.UndefinedError) protocol Access not implemented for %User{age: 27, name: "jose"}
```

We will cover how structs interacts with protocols in the next chapter.
