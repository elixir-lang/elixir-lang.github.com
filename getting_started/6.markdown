# {{ page.title }}

In "Basic Types", we learned about strings and used the `is_binary/1` function for checks:

```iex
iex> string = "hello"
"hello"
iex> is_binary string
true
```

In this chapter, we will understand what binaries are, how they associate with strings and what a single-quoted value, `'like this'`, means in Elixir.

## 6.1 UTF-8 and Unicode

A string is a UTF-8 encoded binary. In order to understand exactly what we mean by that, we need to understand the difference in between bytes and codepoints.

The Unicode standard assigns codepoints to many of the characters we know. For example, the letter `a` has codepoint `97` while the letter `ł` has codepoint `322`. When writing the string `"hełło"` to disk, we need to convert this codepoint to bytes. Since a byte can represent a number from `0` to `255`, if we adopted a rule that said one byte represents one codepoint, we wouldn't be able to write `"hełło"`, because it uses the codepoint `322`. But of course, given you can actually read `"hełło"` in your screen, it means it is represented *somehow*. That's when encodings come in.

When representing codepoints in bytes, we need to encode them somehow, and Elixir chose the UTF-8 encoding as its main and default encoding. When we say a string is a UTF-8 encoded binary, we mean a string is a bunch of bytes, organized in way to represent certain codepoints, as specified by the UTF-8 encoding.

Since we have codepoints like `ł` assigned with the number `322`, we actually need more than one byte to represent it. That's why we see a difference when we calculate the `byte_size/1` of a string compared to its `String.length/1`:

```iex
iex> string = "hełło"
"hełło"
iex> byte_size string
7
iex> String.length string
5
```

UTF-8 requires one byte to represent the codepoints `h`, `e` and `o`, but two bytes to represent `ł`. In Elixir, you can get a codepoint's value by using `?`:

```iex
iex> ?a
97
iex> ?ł
322
```

You can also use the functions in [the `String` module](/docs/stable/String.html) to split a string in its codepoints:

```iex
iex> String.codepoints("hełło")
["h", "e", "ł", "ł", "o"]
```

You will see that Elixir has excellent support for working with strings and it also supports many of the Unicode operations. In fact, Elixir passes all the tests showcased in the ["The string type is broken"](http://mortoray.com/2013/11/27/the-string-type-is-broken/) article.

However, strings are just part of the story. If a string is a binary and we have used a `is_binary/1` function, Elixir probably has an underlying type empowering strings, and that is exactly true. Let's talk about binaries!

## 6.2 Binaries (and bitstrings)

In Elixir, you can define a binary using `<<>>`:

```iex
iex> <<0, 1, 2, 3>>
<<0, 1, 2, 3>>
iex> byte_size <<0, 1, 2, 3>>
4
```

A binary is just a sequence of bytes. Of course those bytes can be organized in any way and they can be organized in a sequence that do not make them a valid string:

```iex
iex> String.valid?(<239, 191, 191>>)
false
```

The string concatenation operation is actually a binary concatenation operator:

```iex
iex> <<0, 1>> <> <<2, 3>>
<<0, 1, 2, 3>>
```

There is a common trick used in Elixir which is to concatenate the null byte `<<0>>` to a string to see its inner binary representation:

```iex
iex> "hełło" <> <<0>>
<<104, 101, 197, 130, 197, 130, 111, 0>>
```

Each number given to a binary is meant to represent a byte and therefore must go up to 255. Binaries allow modifiers to be given to store numbers bigger than 255 or to convert a codepoint to its utf8 representation:

```iex
iex> <<255>>
<<255>>
iex> <<256>> # truncated
<<0>>
iex> <<256 :: size(16)>> # use 16 bits to store the number (2 bytes)
<<1, 0>>
iex> <<256 :: utf8>> # the number is a codepoint
"Ā"
iex> <<256 :: utf8, 0>>
<<196, 128, 0>>
```

If a byte has 8 bits, what happens if we pass a size of 1 bit?

```iex
iex> <<1 :: size(1)>>
<<1 :: size(1)>>
iex> <<2 :: size(1)>> # truncated
<<0>>
iex> is_binary(<< 1 :: size(1)>>)
false
iex> is_bitstring(<< 1 :: size(1)>>)
true
iex> bit_size(<< 1 :: size(1)>>)
1
```

Interesting... the value is no longer a binary, but a bitstring! I.e. it is just a bunch of bits. So a binary is a bitstring where the number of bits is divisible by 8!

We can also pattern match on binaries / bitstrings:

```iex
iex> <<0, 1, x>> = <<0, 1, 2>>
<<0, 1, 2>>
iex> x
2
iex> <<0, 1, x>> = <<0, 1, 2, 3>>
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: <<0, 1, 2, 3>>
```

Note each entry in the binary is expected to match exactly 8 bits. However, we can match on the rest of the binary modifier:

```iex
iex> <<0, 1, x :: binary>> = <<0, 1, 2, 3>>
<<0, 1, 2, 3>>
iex> x
<<2, 3>>
```

The pattern above only works if the binary is at the end of `<<>>`. Similar results can retrieved with the string concatenation operator `<>`:

```iex
iex> "he" <> rest = "hello"
"hello"
iex> rest
"llo"
```

This finishes our tour on bitstrings, binaries and strings. A string is a UTF-8 encoded binary and a binary is a bitstring where the number of bits is divisible by 8. Although this shows the flexibility Elixir provides to work with bits and bytes, 99% of the time you will be working with binaries and using the `is_binary/1` and `byte_size/1` functions.

## 6.3 Char lists

A char list is nothing more than a list of characters:

```iex
iex> 'hełło'
[104, 101, 322, 322, 111]
iex> is_list 'hełło'
```

You can see that, instead of containing bytes, a char list contains the codepoints of the characters in between single-quotes. So while a double-quotes represents a string (i.e. a binary), single-quotes represents a char list (i.e. a list).

In practice, char lists are used mostly when interfacing with Erlang, in particular old libraries that do not accept binaries as arguments. You can convert a char list to a string and back by using the `to_string/1` and `to_char_list/1` functions:

```iex
iex> to_char_list "hełło"
[104, 101, 322, 322, 111]
iex> to_string 'hełło'
"hełło"
iex> to_string :hello
"hello"
iex> to_string 1
"1"
```

Note that those functions are polymorphic. They not only convert char lists to strings, but also integers to strings, atoms to strings and so on. With binaries, strings and char lists out of the way, it is time to talk about key-value data structures.
